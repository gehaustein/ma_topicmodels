<p class="contents">Why do we have this Green Paper and EP report? Three factors justify this exercise aimed at making the European consumer acquis, i.e. eight Directives adopted between 1985 and 1999, more consistent and more modern.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the rapid development of new marketing techniques, primarily e-commerce, has rendered some of the European laws obsolete.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there are many inconsistencies in the current acquis, which contains different legal definitions of identical concepts.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the decision made in the past to opt for minimum harmonisation, thereby allowing the Member States to retain specific national provisions, has resulted in fragmentation of the legal environment, given that the rules in force lay down a minimum European standard but do not define a single method for meeting it. The consequence of this, according to the September 2006 Eurobarometer, is that 50% of citizens are more wary of cross-border purchases while 71% believe that it is more difficult to assert their rights when buying from sellers based in another Member State.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, it is important for economic operators in that they will benefit from a secure regulatory environment and will be able to make the most of an internal market comprising nearly 500 million consumers. One of the challenges of this review is enter a qualitative stage, to some extent laying the foundations for a European consumer code. However, what method should be used? The European Parliament fully supports the methodology proposed by the Commission, namely a mixed or combined approach: on the one hand, it is based on the definition of a horizontal instrument to ensure maximum harmonisation, applying identical legal concepts across the current Directives; on the other hand, it provides for the revision, where necessary, of some of the sectoral Directives, where minimum harmonisation will continue to apply.</p>
<p class="contents">	</p>
<p class="contents">The horizontal instrument must be formulated with a view to bringing together the basic rights of European consumers. First of all, it will contain a single definition of ‘consumer’, which in Parliament’s view should apply to any natural or legal person acting for purposes which are outside their trade, business or profession, while a ‘professional’ should be defined as any person acting for purposes relating to their trade, business or profession. You may ask why such a restrictive definition of ‘consumer’ is necessary? In fact, it is in the interest of consumers themselves. There is a high risk that extending the specific protection offered by consumer law to a broader range of beneficiaries would result in a lower level of protection, which we want to avoid.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, the horizontal instrument will guarantee consumers’ right of withdrawal in the case of purchases made on the Internet or in a doorstep situation. The arrangements for calculating the period of withdrawal will be harmonised: at the moment the withdrawal period is, for example, a minimum of seven days for distance contracts, but in certain countries, such as Germany and Finland, a 14-day period has been introduced. The methods of exercising the right of withdrawal will also be harmonised.</p>
<p class="contents">Thirdly, the horizontal instrument will clarify what is meant by ‘unfair terms’ in contracts between professionals and consumers. There will be a black list of banned terms, a grey list of terms presumed to be unfair and other terms which consumers could demonstrate to be unfair by means of legal action.</p>
<p class="contents">Fourthly, the duration of the two-year statutory guarantee will be extended to include the period when the goods are out of use for repair.</p>
<p class="contents">Fifthly, the right to remedies will be reaffirmed and its arrangements clarified; above all, the horizontal instrument will be able to adapt to change. Specific legal questions will continue to be dealt with in the so-called sectoral Directives and will for the most part be subject to minimum harmonisation, with, in our view, a mutual recognition clause, whose mechanism will have to be defined and which should facilitate the resolution of any legal conflicts.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, my report stresses that without information, and without being able to invoke these remedies, consumers have nothing but virtual rights. Effective application of their rights requires national and European information campaigns, greater visibility and a more active role for the European Consumer Centres, and the facilitation of judicial and extrajudicial remedies.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, Parliament recalls the discussion on collective redress. As rapporteur, I believe that collective redress, as a specific means of resolving mass disputes, is an important method that warrants further consideration. I call on the Commission to submit precise studies and legal proposals in the next few months. However, I must state clearly that the European form of collective redress will be different from American class actions, whose very proactive philosophy involving the aggressive canvassing of consumers by unscrupulous lawyers, and methods that provide, in particular, for the award of punitive damages borne by the operators, are completely alien to the judicial culture of European countries.</p>
<p class="contents">On the contrary, I believe that a European procedure will have to allow associations to act on behalf of all those who have suffered similar losses caused by the same dishonest professional to obtain, through a single process and without any express action on their part, the compensation they are owed.</p>
<p class="contents">To conclude, I would like to say that this Green Paper defends ambitious goals and I personally hope that Parliament’s vote clearly indicates the way forward for the Europe of consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to start by thanking most sincerely Ms Patrie, all the shadow rapporteurs in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and Mrs Wallis, who gave the opinion for the Committee on Legal Affairs. It was excellent teamwork, with very close cooperation on this ambitious report. I am not just being courteous: it is sincere recognition of Parliament’s hard work.</p>
<p class="contents">The eight consumer protection directives under review focus on the contractual stage of the processes of sales or services provision. The eight directives in place deal, for instance, with consumer sales, distance contracts, doorstep-selling and unfair contract terms. However, they are all based on minimum harmonisation, leaving us with a patchwork of national rules built on top of the Community’s standards. This regulatory fragmentation is confusing for consumers and costly for businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why, on 8 February 2007, the Commission began a major consultation – a Green Paper on the review of the consumer acquis. The aim of the review is to simplify and adapt the existing rules by reducing regulatory fragmentation. This should, ultimately, improve consumer confidence in the internal market and allow businesses, in particular small and medium-sized enterprises, to trade more easily across the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">Through this process, we have the opportunity to contribute to a truly integrated EU retail market, providing consumers with lower prices and more choice and giving a measured stimulus to growth and jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">I am glad that the Commission and the European Parliament agree on a common line in approaching this very important and challenging issue. Your support will be an important reference for our follow-up work and for specific proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">After the European Parliament has adopted its report on the Green Paper, the outcome of the consultation will be published on the Health and Consumer Protection Directorate-General website. This will take place in October. However, I can already give you an outline of the results on some key issues.</p>
<p class="contents">First of all, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s support for a mixed approach to the review, consisting of a combination of horizontal instrument-regulating aspects which some different directives have in common, and maintaining specific aspects in sectoral directives. I can already inform you that this mixed approach is supported by a large majority of respondents to the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards harmonisation, the Commission welcomes Parliament’s endorsement of the principle of targeted full harmonisation, that is to say, full harmonisation of key aspects of consumer protection directives, which are needed in order to achieve the internal market for businesses and for consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">This support for full harmonisation across the consumer acquis <span class="bold">− </span>or targeted full harmonisation <span class="bold">−</span> is shared by the majority of respondents to the Green Paper, in particular by businesses and Member States. Nevertheless, minimum rules will remain in several areas. The Commission agrees with Parliament that the mutual recognition clause should apply in these areas in order to make sure that additional requirements imposed by Member States do not create unjustified internal market barriers.</p>
<p class="contents">On more specific issues, such as harmonisation of withdrawal rights across the acquis, the definition of delivery of goods or the drawing up of a combined grey and black list of unfair contract terms at EU level, the majority of respondents to the Green Paper have expressed views which are largely in line with the report to be voted on today.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank you for your commitment to helping European citizens to enjoy all the benefits of the internal market. I look forward to working with you to fulfil our common goals and to achieve a citizens’ internal market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Clearly, the Committee on Legal Affairs welcomes very much the Green Paper and is grateful that the Commission has waited for Parliament’s opinion.</p>
<p class="contents">The word that runs through my committee’s opinion is coherence, and the need for coherence. We see this very much as part of the ‘better law-making’ agenda, which was discussed in this House earlier this week, but also as coherence across internal market legislation and across into the whole area of civil and commercial law, and contract law is very much part and parcel of that.</p>
<p class="contents">I would have to start by saying that there are some of us who, in dealing with this matter in the Legal Affairs Committee, have perhaps begun to regret the passing of what, in the previous legislative term, was our joint Committee for Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. It is good that consumer affairs are now dealt with by the same committee, but it is perhaps a shame that we have lost that focus on the internal market and civil and commercial law. That clear focus has been somewhat fractured. In the past, we, as a Parliament, have been very quick to condemn the Commission for a lack of joined-up thinking, and we must not ourselves now be guilty of the same difficulty. That is why the Committee on Legal Affairs is so clear that in dealing with this review we must keep an eye on the wider context of contract law and civil and commercial law as a whole.</p>
<p class="contents">In that respect, I must of course refer to the work on the common frame of reference to do with contract law. Much work has been done on that in the past and our committee hopes that much work will continue to be done on it in the future. That is absolutely essential to the opinion that we have delivered.</p>
<p class="contents">The contract law project is at the heart of better law-making, and arguably this review of the acquis should be the jewel in that crown. They are inextricably entwined and, even if the Member States are reticent about the whole of the contract law project, this Parliament is not and will not be in the future, and looks to the Commission to pursue that work together.</p>
<p class="contents">Of course, with consumer law, it is very difficult. We have all said that we want more harmonisation, and that seems to be the general tenor of the responses received. But consumer law needs to be very much accessible and understandable to our citizens for our internal market to work. Both sides of the bargain need to understand their rights and obligations.</p>
<p class="contents">In a national context, consumer law has grown up over the years, perhaps sometimes as a result of experiences at national level – often bad experiences, unfortunately – and also within a certain cultural context. That means that the consumer law that we all know in our national environment is a law that has some resonance between us and our citizens. It is accepted. People know what it is about. But how do we get that same resonance, that same understanding, that same accessibility at European level? That is what we have got to strive to achieve in any horizontal instrument if we are to give consumers across the internal market the confidence that they obviously currently still lack in order to use the internal market much more.</p>
<p class="contents">Now, it is also clear from what I have said that we are concerned, as a committee, that we make sure that the consumer acquis works together with other European law instruments, specifically private international law instruments like Rome I.</p>
<p class="contents">We cannot go on for ever having this battle about whose law shall apply. We need, therefore, to have the contract law project, the common frame of reference. We need a horizontal instrument, and we need to aspire to what some have called the ‘blue flag’ giving us European terms and conditions of trade and European consumer and contract provisions that will really make our internal market work. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

From our perspective, I believe we could have fully supported the outcome of the committee's work. Consumer protection is extremely important, especially to the PPE-DE Group.</p>
<p class="contents">I have three minutes, so let me say a few key words: first of all, it is absolutely right, as Mrs Wallis has also just said, that there is a need to review the joined-up thinking – the coherence – of the various Directives as part of the ‘better law-making’ agenda, and to some extent to consolidate the common elements with a view to a systematic review. In this context, however, we do not want to see any expansion towards a consumer contract law, and the efforts must also be coordinated very closely with the work on the common frame of reference (CFR), which must be taken into consideration. What is also important, from our perspective, is absolute coherence with the provisions of Rome I, i.e. the applicable provisions in private international law.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the individual Directives, I broadly endorse the minimum harmonisation approach – and what Mrs Patrie has said – but this does not exclude the possibility that individual areas should be conclusively regulated where possible. However, a cautious approach should be adopted here, taking account of the cultural characteristics and circumstances in the individual Member States; otherwise, overregulation will be the result.</p>
<p class="contents">I would just like to draw attention to Amendment 4 tabled by the Socialist Group, which states that in the framework of harmonisation no regulatory provision may be abolished in a Member State. This would mean that if harmonisation takes place – in other words, if everything is added together at the end – then the outcome will be the opposite of what you, Commissioner, have quite rightly called for, namely clear and simple legislation that works for everyone. Instead, the outcome could be overregulation, and that is not what we want.</p>
<p class="contents">More generally, the Commission has raised a number of sometimes very serious questions about the individual Directives, which require very careful review and to which we have responded individually. In particular, we reject class actions: we do not want US conditions in Europe. We also reject producers' liability or the restriction of freedom of contract if individually negotiated clauses or the price is to be reviewed in the framework of the standard terms and conditions of business and the abuse clauses.</p>
<p class="contents">I just want to point out that an integrated approach is crucial. Consumers are not only consumers; they are also entrepreneurs, company employees – could I just ask how much time I have left, I was not listening before: I thought I had three minutes, so I am being quite quick – and they also have an interest in the welfare of their companies. A holistic view is therefore essential. I am sure the Commission takes the same view. We cannot only ever look at this issue from one perspective. Consumers are not well-served if they are presented with comprehensive legislation that ultimately destroys the opportunities for the economy and their own businesses.</p>
<p class="contents">On that note, I would like to reiterate my thanks to everyone involved in the deliberations on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am very grateful for that.</p>
<p class="contents">What does the approach taken here mean? The task, after all, is to do something for consumers, and to make the law simpler, clearer and more comprehensible. This is the objective we want to pursue, so this mixed approach is precisely the right one. Horizontal aspects, full harmonisation where possible, for example as regards the definition of the consumer or the definition of business, is what this is about, but it is also about implementing the European Union's Treaties, which allow the Member States to retain or introduce a higher standard of law, if they consider it right to do so. This law must naturally be respected.</p>
<p class="contents">On the issue of mutual recognition, this means confidence among citizens and it means consumer confidence. That is what this is about, and that is what we need to develop. I fully endorse what Mrs Wallis has said: we must ensure that private international law, as defined in Rome I, for example, is also respected. Otherwise, we will again have this patchwork which leads to a lack of clarity and to legal uncertainty, which is not what we want. For that reason, my group says a resounding 'no' to this bizarre internal market clause which is constantly being upheld by some Members of this House. None of them has so far been able to explain to me what they are actually trying to achieve. However, I suspect that what is behind it is an attempt to call the provisions of Rome I into question once more. We say a resounding 'no' to that; that is why we do not want this provision.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards class actions, Mr Lechner, it really is becoming quite ridiculous when I hear you say that we do not want US conditions. Of course we do not want them. We want class actions which help our citizens to assert their rights but respect the traditions and culture that we enjoy in the European Union. We certainly do not want to introduce US conditions. That is not what this is about. It is about enabling our citizens to assert their rights. I think it is most unfortunate that your group is still insisting on saying 'no' here. You really should think about what you actually want.</p>
<p class="contents">We want more clarity; in other words, we want to reduce the lack of clarity in the law so as to ensure the unhindered application of the principles contained in the European Union's Treaties, and we want to honour the international agreements that we have concluded. This is the basis which will ensure that consumers are genuinely well-protected, that they are aware of their rights and that they are also equipped with the means to enforce these rights. If we can achieve that, Mrs Kuneva and Mrs Patrie, we will have done a lot of good and we will be making real progress. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The internal market is not self-serving; its purpose is to serve people, thus it is essential to guarantee consumer rights in all EU countries by means of active goods, services, capital and labour markets. The labour market available in the EU, regulating the <span class="italic">acquis</span>, is not efficient in practice. In view of this, the Commission sets out its own aim of achieving a real consumer internal market while striking a balance between a high level of consumer protection and the competitiveness of enterprises. A sustainable approach is required that poses no conflict of interest between consumers and economic operators. However, this sustainable approach is missing. Frequently Member States make use of their right to enact stricter regulations securing a higher level of protection for consumers. I believe that the revision of the <span class="italic">acquis </span>should result in equal consumer protection levels, regardless of a consumer’s country of residence or the country where goods or services are purchased. Therefore, I approve of the proposed horizontal method, which should be applied to all consumer agreements involving both local and international transactions. However, talking of the interests of consumers and economic operators, the interests of the latter often prevail. Consumers are forced to accept almost total responsibility for a transaction, and they are subjected to additional conditions and price increases in the course of a service provision; agreements may be terminated <span class="italic">ex parte</span>. This is characteristic of uncoordinated sectors in particular, such as residential construction. Consumers are forced to resort to the court system to resolve disputes with contractors, and they are deprived of any substantial material or moral compensation. Therefore, I think that the practice of testing for fraudulence as regards the main subject matter of the contract and for price adequacy should be initiated. Furthermore, as regards contract violation according to the horizontal measure, I approve of the introduction of the general consumer entitlement to compensation for material and moral damages. In addition, I think that not only should consumer law be related to civil and commercial law, but that measures should also be taken to limit the penetration of low-quality products and services into the market.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I must admit that the first draft you presented made it quite difficult for us to introduce substantive amendments. Unfortunately, however, the situation has changed somewhat. The debate in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection and the proposals, most of which came from Members of the PPE-DE and ALDE, in my view send the wrong signal to the Commission, which now has the task of developing the genuinely substantive further steps on the basis of the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Above all, however, the outcome in the Committee on the Internal Market sends out the wrong signal about consumer protection. For us, the protection of the interests of the consumer is the priority. If I may remind you all of recent developments, notably the product recalls of toys, it should be clear to every one of us that there is an urgent need for action. In the Committee on the Internal Market, we voted against the report because in our view it pointed in the wrong direction in some respects. Again, it was Mrs Patrie who made very committed efforts to produce compromise amendments. Let me say upfront that the voting behaviour, the recommendation to our group, will largely depend on the outcome of today's vote.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me identify what could be regarded as our 'sore points'. We do not want to see full harmonisation resulting in the elimination of the stringent consumer standards that exist in some Member States. Apart from individual issues of law and legal definitions – and Mrs Gebhardt has reiterated this point – we believe that minimum harmonisation is more appropriate. However, that should not, in our view, go hand in hand with the principle of mutual recognition. In the case of transnational contracts, that could ultimately mean that consumers are confronted with 27 different legal systems, which would be quite overwhelming, to my mind. Furthermore, the indirect introduction of the country of origin principle is in our view also inappropriate as a means of protecting consumer interests.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the exclusion of unfair terms in contracts, we want the Directive on unfair terms in consumer contracts to be applicable to individually negotiated clauses as well. We also take the view that the introduction of producers' liability will give major impetus for consumers to utilise the benefits of the European internal market as it will give them more confidence that their rights will genuinely be asserted, including in relation to a producer in another Member State. Mrs Wallis has drawn particular attention to this situation.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would ask you to support our Amendment 16 in which we make it clear that we would appreciate a legal and academic appraisal of the instrument of class actions. This request has been endorsed by a majority in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. That should encourage most of us to support the motion. In that respect, perhaps I do want to see US conditions in Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The question we must ask is: what is most important in a consumer programme – consumer rights or the rights of enterprises? In my view the choice is simple. We must strengthen consumer rights and enterprises must take responsibility for their products.</p>
<p class="contents">The Green Paper discusses how a better regulatory framework will increase trade between countries, but the top priority in a consumer regulatory framework must still be to reinforce consumer rights. The biggest problem experienced by consumers at present is that it is difficult to have a dispute over consumer rights between different countries examined because there is no body to settle cross-border disputes. But, on the whole, this problem is not addressed in the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">First and foremost, the EU should develop bodies to settle such disputes, not create more EU legislation. This approach is also supported by the European consumer organisation BUC. The rules that apply now are minimum harmonisation, i.e. a common lowest level is agreed below which no country may fall. At the same time, it is possible for countries to have stricter national legislation. To change that to full harmonisation at EU level runs counter to the subsidiarity principle which so many claim to uphold, including the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">The GUE/NGL Group is opposed to the proposal in the report to combine minimum legislation with the principle of mutual recognition. Mutual recognition is similar to the country of origin principle. There is a risk that we will see a race towards the lowest level of consumer rights. Enterprises may be tempted to become established in countries with weak consumer protection. The aim of the Green Paper is of course said to be to strengthen the consumer’s position on the EU market. But if we are serious about strengthening consumer protection, we must vote in favour of the GUE/NGL Group’s amendment, according to which the host country’s rules, i.e. the rules of the country where the goods are purchased, must apply.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, I must say that large parts of the report place the interests of industry first and increase the liberalisation of the internal market. This is a threat to the standards and levels that already exist in many Member States. The report introduces the principle of mutual recognition into consumer legislation. This goes against all efforts to improve consumer protection. Therefore, for the sake of consumer protection, I and the GUE/NGL Group are voting against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Permit me to offer my sincere congratulations. I think that a revision of the <span class="italic">acquis communautaire </span>in the consumer protection field is necessary not only because of the evolution of the European market and of the relationship between producers and consumers but also because of the problems which occurred following enlargement of the European Union .</p>
<p class="contents">From this last point of view, I would like to draw your attention to a negative situation that occurs in the consumer protection field in the new Member States. I notice the deficiencies and the great delays in the process of labelling goods in the languages of the new Member States that, as of 1 January 2007, became official EU languages.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, most of the goods imported from the European Union into Romania are not labelled in Romanian and they cause serious prejudice to consumers from the point of view of quality, characteristics, usage methods and expiry dates. I believe that it is discrimination against a part of the EU population unable to direct consumption on the basis of correct information.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why the revision process of the <span class="italic">acquis</span> in the consumer protection field should consider this issue in order to remove this delay existing in order to protect all European consumers, irrespective of the Member State they reside in.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The European Commission’s role is to ensure that the consumer protection mechanisms proposed in the report serve to boost the level of consumer confidence.

<p class="contents">In the European Union we have, since the 1970s, had high ambitions for driving through consumer protection and we have achieved a great deal in this area. However, many years and many laws later, it is time to stand back and look again at this policy area that affects all Europeans, to update it in the various aspects indicated in the Green Paper itself and to make it more coherent as regards both the definitions and the concepts. The fact that we can have this debate in the same week as we are having debates on the single market review and on better regulation works out very well.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer laws must be good laws and consumer protection and the internal market are so closely tied to each other, both legally and in respect of policy, that it would be good to coordinate these two reviews. In any case, it is high time that we dispelled the myth that the completion of the internal market and pushing through consumer protection are incompatible objectives. After all, European policy not only offers added value through a high level of consumer protection, but also, and to a significant extent, it enables those consumers to enjoy the full benefits of the internal market. Confidence, legal certainty and expert knowledge are crucial to this. Through what is referred to as the mixed approach, which has already been explained by my fellow Members, we can realise these three objectives. I am also confident that we should not be afraid to push for maximum harmonisation where this would be useful.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, let us not forget enforcement. That is the final element of good legislation. However, law enforcement is not just a matter of private claims, whether individual or class actions; it is also something that the Member States have to achieve at a structural level through diligent supervision and through much better cooperation between administrations across national boundaries. The recent appearance of unsafe toys on our market – a fellow Member has already alluded to this – shows that there are still threats to the health and safety of consumers and that Member States do not take this task sufficiently seriously. I would also be very pleased to hear, therefore, from the Commissioner – whose introduction I especially enjoyed – whether she also plans to do something about structural enforcement by the Member States in the review of the acquis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are very grateful for the work that our rapporteur, Ms Patrie, has carried out.</p>
<p class="contents">As has been mentioned several times, this is a timely debate, given announcements made in the summer and again this week for a recall of dangerous products from China that were sold bearing the CE mark – fooling our consumers into believing that such products are safe and meet EU standards. The focus of our debate today and the central objective of our consumer policy must be the protection of consumer safety and health – particularly as regards vulnerable consumers and children. We have to ensure that consumers have rights and remedies when something goes wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to use this debate to stress the importance of enforcement, as Ms Thyssen has. The fact is that we have laws on our statute books, but Member States are not demonstrating sufficient commitment to transposing these laws. Long delays are denying consumers their rights. Where consumer laws have been transposed, enforcement is often patchy and haphazard. The RAPEX report, in the case of the notification of dangerous products, shows that not all Member States are participating in the notification system. There is an increased awareness of product safety by both business and national authorities, but more action, Commissioner, is required. Recalling dangerous Chinese toy imports can only be the last resort.</p>
<p class="contents">We have a general product safety law, we have a toy safety law but we need to step up enforcement and inspection regimes. This is the only way to ensure that consumers have genuine and effective protection. That is why, Commissioner, I want to encourage you to set up a consumer scoreboard as a tool to report on Member States’ activities in the consumer protection field and to help us, as elected representatives, to follow up on weak enforcement and delayed transposition.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, Commissioner, I want to thank you for coming to me directly, as chair, to discuss the issue of the safety of toys.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to pledge the support of our committee to work with you to crack down on the import of dangerous toy products, to get tougher controls at our borders to intercept these products, to obtain stronger national inspection and enforcement regimes, to ensure that products do not get on the shelves in our shops and, of course, to have joint action with the US to force China to raise its production standards to meet EU safety standards. This review, I believe, is a chance for the EU to demonstrate our commitment to European consumers and to offer the highest standards possible – and, indeed, for Europe to be a beacon of consumer protection for the rest of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Simplification and improvement of the regulatory environment merits particular interest in terms of how it affects both consumers and enterprises. This is especially true regarding the latter, because 90% of them are SMEs, which are the driving force behind many fast-developing economies.</p>
<p class="contents">It is also important to link the problems concerning consumer contracts with work on contract law in its entirety within the context of the ongoing process aimed at developing common frameworks for European contract law. I also support the view that harmonisation should lead to a comparable level of consumer protection across all the Member States, without full harmonisation of all national provisions. Embarking upon the latter could mean having to wait significantly longer before the desired effects in the area made themselves felt.</p>

What we must do is not only maintain those rights in the current legislation – including in relation to financial services – but also improve them in those cases which are not sufficiently covered, such as the areas of telecommunications and energy.</p>
<p class="contents">As stressed in the proposals made by my group, any horizontal instrument in this area must focus on defining a limited set of general rules common to all vertical consumer protection instruments. This would ensure a high level of consumer protection with the approved method of minimum harmonisation being used, combined with the country of destination principle, so as not to compromise existing national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">It would be unacceptable for a consumer rights directive to return to any country of origin principle as a general rule, as was attempted in the initial version of the directive on liberalisation of services.</p>
<p class="contents">The consumer’s freedom to choose the most favourable legislation must prevail. However, the report presented contains several contradictions which must be rectified by the amendments on which we are to vote. In this way we can protect the essential principle of guaranteeing that the binding general rules on the protection of consumers’ rights respect the rights that exist in each country and do not prevent these rights from possibly being improved. In fact, they must be capable of promoting and improving all existing rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The opportunity should also be taken to apply the rules on unfair terms to all negotiated contracts which contain unfair terms, even if they have been individually negotiated. Rules governing the direct liability of producers must also be maintained for those cases where the contracts do not ensure consumer protection. That is what we are trying to achieve. If this is not achieved, as already stated, we will vote against the report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am sure that is really going to help Ms Kuneva move forward as quickly as possible with the proposal for the first stages of the so-called ‘horizontal directive’.</p>
<p class="contents">I particularly want to thank Ms Patrie for her contribution to this. I have worked with her in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection on consumer protection issues for many years. She has great expertise, which I think has worked through in this. I am sorry we will not be seeing quite so much of her, but this report shows her commitment to this area.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to thank the Commissioner for her energetic promotion of consumer protection and the profile she is giving to this. Mrs McCarthy referred specifically to issues surrounding products and toys. They are not part of this debate, but we will have a chance to discuss them with the Commissioner at the committee meeting next week.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to mention a previous piece of work we were all involved in that has not been mentioned so far, which is the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive. That was a landmark piece of consumer protection legislation, because, for the first time, it set out the harmonised rules on unfair commercial practices to be applied across the European Union. In many countries, that whole area of dealing with unfair practices was not really developed at all in national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of colleagues have referred to the issue of compliance, and let us not forget that is a foundation which is still being transposed in many Member States, including the United Kingdom. So we have to keep the pressure up on this, along with the follow-up to the Green Paper. I want to highlight the fact that the Commissioner has a clear direction from this Parliament, which I am sure she will have in the vote today, to move quickly on the horizontal directive – we have clear agreement on that. There are, clearly, other areas we wish to debate, particularly the issue of cost and compliance with different standards in different markets. Let us not forget that, on the one hand, we want to ensure consumer confidence – as the Commissioner highlighted in her speech – and for consumers to feel that they have a well-developed set of rights that are really meaningful. But, at the same time, we want to encourage innovative, new businesses to come and put products and services onto the market and not to be discouraged by the legal regime they are faced with. I have to say that on some of the issues – and I have raised this with the Commissioner – that are being talked about in other areas, on the reform of Rome I, for example, small businesses are extremely concerned about the potential costs of compliance with extensive requirements under 27 jurisdictions. If we provide high levels of consumer protection but we discourage companies from entering those markets, then we are not doing consumers a favour. That is the balance we intend to seek.</p>
<p class="contents">I was delighted that the Commissioner specifically mentioned that mutual recognition will be an important part of this. On the unfair commercial practices, we argued for an internal market clause and it was voted through. We have been entirely consistent for this side. That is part of the balance that we seek and I am confident that we can achieve it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The Green Paper is a very good tool for identifying problems in, and seeking solutions to, the consumer acquis. One of the solutions proposed by Mrs Patrie is a combined approach to the consumer acquis involving full harmonisation in the cross-cutting definitions and minimum harmonisation at sector level. I can understand this approach, and I also support it. In my view, however, we also need to ensure that harmonisation of consumer acquis does not lead to a decline in the level of protection of any consumers whatsoever. Accordingly, when we discussed the matter in the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I submitted a proposal concerning what is known as a ‘consumer protection guarantee’. Unfortunately, the proposal was defeated in the vote in committee, but now the Socialist Group in the European Parliament has resubmitted it so that we can vote on it here in plenary.</p>
<p class="contents">The point of this proposal is to give all European consumers a safeguard, or guarantee, that the rights already obtained will not be at risk even in the case of full legislative harmonisation. I believe that this is crucial in building consumer confidence in the EU, and in fostering an appreciation of why we are making common EU rules. After all, we do need common rules in a number of areas, among other things to keep pace with the growth and development of the volume of trade on the Internet, for example. As a matter of fact, it is widely held among the public of some Member States that their own particular country has the very highest level of consumer protection. Denmark is one such country, and thus all EU measures in the field of consumer legislation are regarded with apprehension. Purely and simply, the public fears a lowering of standards.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my deep conviction that the introduction of a consumer protection guarantee – that is, a guarantee that no one will be in a less favourable position in the future than he or she is today – really will enable us to both allay these fears and foster an appreciation that it makes sense to pass Community legislation, too. This will be only at the highest level, not at the lowest. Consequently, I would urge everyone to vote in favour of our proposal No 4 during voting time later today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than 70% think that related problems, such as complaints, are difficult to solve when shopping cross-border. A clear majority of consumers feel uncertain of their position on the dance floor of trade. As a result there is no new shopping and the economy and the prosperity of consumers relying on it do not grow as much as they could.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission says that the ideal situation would be if EU consumers could have the same basic rights wherever they were in the Union and wherever they did their shopping. These are nice dreams, but now we need sensible action. Attitudes change slowly and only if the reality of a situation improves. For now reality is harsh and, for example, with many chain stores, faulty goods can only be returned to the original place of purchase, even if the chain has shops in the place or country where the consumer actually lives.</p>
<p class="contents">The consumer must be king. Consumer law should actually protect consumers. The laws therefore need to be brought up to date, harmonised and, in part, expanded. It is odd, for example, how the long arm of EU law does not automatically extend to on-line auctions. The level of consumer protection at national level must not be allowed to fall because of EU laws.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, attention needs to be focused on improving the quality of information and education for consumers. There are a lot more opportunities today for businesses to lobby for their rights and be aware of them and their obligations, as well as the rights and obligations of the consumer. Without consumers and their trust there is no trade anyway. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In my view, Commissioner, the decision-making process and the submission of your Green Paper are an exemplary model of good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, highlighting that we need this kind of effective cooperation in other areas as well.</p>
<p class="contents">What we are dealing with here, with this more technical report, is the interface between European consumer legislation and European internal market legislation, because on the one hand, we have the development of the common frame of reference, where until now, not enough texts have been available. The issues which have been raised are Rome I, the regulation in the Committee on Legal Affairs and Europe's consumer acquis. I believe that these measures must always be viewed in relation to each other so that in the end we have a coherent and unified law which – as other speakers have already mentioned – is transparent for the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">However, transparency for the consumer does not in every case necessarily mean – as Mr Lechner has already stated – that we should mix up all the highest standards from every Member State into a kind of European hotch-potch; instead, we really should be considering at European level which targeted strategy we need to deploy in order to provide the European consumer with clear and coherent European consumer legislation. The proposal for a ‘blue flag’ for the European consumer, for the purchaser, may have its appeal, but I believe that it would of course be even more important and even better for the internal market if we could successfully guide the Member States along a unified course in their national legislation.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to the issue of minimum and maximum harmonisation. I believe – as some of my colleagues from my group have already said – that we must be cautious in our arguments. The internal market thrives on the fact that the consumers can depend on what they perceive to be valid legal norms. Of course, that only holds good if these legal norms apply everywhere. I therefore welcome the fact that Mrs Gebhardt has said that we need unified definitions of terminology in many areas, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I also believe that we must proceed cautiously on other points and that we must make it clear to the Member States that if we want to have a single internal market and unified consumer protection provisions, this cannot work if we adhere to the notion that 'everyone can add a bit on top', as that is guaranteed to confuse the consumer. That is the line that we will pursue in the vote afterwards as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, the collective data has already been mentioned. We are very well-disposed towards your activities to benefit the consumer, including as regards the issue of class actions. However, it must also be clear that in Europe we definitely wish to rule out US conditions, and so we are very keen to see what you intend to present to us in detail, having already outlined some of it in broad terms. We want to be reassured that you are definitely ruling out US conditions in Europe. Class action lawsuits – and the PPE-DE Group will itself put forward something here – and test cases are entirely in the consumer's interest and that is something that we would also support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is a fundamental issue in the European Parliament and in the European Union, as in fact demonstrated by the very existence of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We would stress that the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency of the EU in relation to consumer policy include not only the review of the Timeshare Directive but also the review of the consumer acquis which is being considered here today, in addition to the Community consumer policy strategy up to 2013 and the Common Frame of Reference on EU Contract Law.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, what we are actually trying to do is create a genuine internal market for consumers and overcome the mistrust of European consumers towards transnational trade, particularly but not solely within the European Union. However, to do this we need to ensure, as confirmed by Mrs Patrie, that consumers know that they can effectively assert their rights in the event of a dispute.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, I must stress the relevance and importance of certain points in the current proposal. Madam President, the legal framework for both professionals and consumers must be effectively modernised, simplified and improved so that confidence in particular is increased. It is also supremely important that within this framework the issues arising from possible conflicts between the Rome I and Rome II Conventions are resolved, while respecting the rights enshrined in these Conventions and the Electronic Commerce Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The examination of consumer protection issues is therefore extremely important, particularly when consumers sign digital content supply contracts. The need to guarantee the effectiveness of the right of consumption is also important so that consumer confidence in the internal market increases, as seems essential to us.</p>
<p class="contents">Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, to conclude I must say that a clearer and more integrated legal framework is needed in order to consolidate the internal market and increase the confidence of European consumers. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

At the same time, however, these consumers must make decisions far more complicated than any in the past. Taking into account the need to improve the efficiency of consumer law on the internal market, I welcome the Commission’s intention to re-evaluate the eight sectoral Directives so that they respond to the challenges of technological progress, and in particular offer precise definitions of rights and duties in an online environment.</p>
<p class="contents">Trusting and informed consumers are at the heart of the dynamics of the European internal market. As long as consumers are sure of their rights, they will show the same confidence when making purchases in a shop or on the Internet whether they do so in their own country or in other countries of the European Union. When consumers make purchasing decisions, for them the most important aspects are protection from dangerous products or dishonest business practices, legal and trading guarantees and the possibility of returning the goods. A set of standardised, common rules valid throughout the EU is therefore important both to consumers and entrepreneurs.</p>
<p class="contents">If consumers are supposed to have enough trust in shopping outside their own Member State and if they are supposed to make use of the benefits of the internal market, they need assurances that if a mistake happens they have at their disposal efficient mechanisms to demand compensation. Consumer disputes require finely tuned mechanisms that do not incur disproportionate costs and delays relative to the value of the product or service about which the complaint has been made. Consumers need accurate information in order to be able to defend their rights. They can make use of informal mechanisms such as SOLVIT or of services provided by consumer organisations, which have to be adequately staffed and funded. I believe that when reviewing the consumer acquis we will take the opportunity to prepare better legislation written in simple language that citizens will find easy to understand.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, to conclude I would like to express my pleasure at the participation of my group of visitors from the Slovak Prešov and Košice regions precisely in this debate, which is so important for European consumers.

But it was obvious in many cases that the existing weaknesses are not connected to the European legal framework but to the absence of implementation or the inadequate, copy-pasted transposition thereof into national legislation. Unfortunately, better regulation will not offer a greater security if it is not implemented or if it is misimplemented.</p>
<p class="contents">Between Member States there are significant gaps on the information and awareness level about consumer rights and the abilities to use the existing instruments. The institutions responsible for applying laws and the consumers associations have different levels of efficiency. These gaps do not lap over the ordinary old Member States - new Member States division, but they are connected to local traditions and practices.</p>
<p class="contents">High consumer vulnerability creates the risk that the market of a certain country becomes a transaction place for low-quality or dangerous goods originating from another country and thus it emphasizes the scepticism about the benefits of the single market.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to ensure the adequate implementation of law and the observance of the existing rules and to continue the information measures for citizens. Consumers aware of their rights are an advantage for the single market itself as they can correctly select between market providers, thus transforming competition into a factor of development.</p>
<p class="contents">We live in the service society. The proposals included in the Green Paper sometimes give the feeling that the rules only concern trade of goods. Electronic commerce is also excluded from the scope of the revision. We ask the Commission to consider these issues in drawing up its future projects as the invisible character of goods, meaning services, makes consumers more vulnerable than in the case of goods. Because Since do not have the necessary technical ability to check the quality of services, they need a legal framework in order for them to be protected. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The first one is a bit of a confession: I am a mega shopper. I love to shop on the internet; I love to shop at home and abroad. So, I could say that I have a vested interest in consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">We all know the feeling. When you shop, things do not always go well. You come home, and the suit does not look as good as it was supposed to. You buy something on the internet, and Amazon.com sends you the wrong books. You try to get in touch with someone in the shop but do not get an e-mail response. You go to the shop; the salesperson looks at you as if you were some kind of serial killer and you try to say, ‘Well, what do you think I am doing? I put my fingers into the electric socket or something? No, the machine does not work!’</p>
<p class="contents">So, you do not always get the best service in the world. This is what we are discussing today; trying to get it to work a little bit better. So we know the feeling of what it is like when things go wrong.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point is that very few people, not even Mrs Pleštinská’s visitors’ group, know that the European Union is the friend of the consumer.</p>
<p class="contents">I know it does not sound sexy, but the ‘sale of consumer goods and guarantees’ <span class="bold">–</span>what is that all about? Well, it basically says that you get your money back or you can exchange your product within two years, if the contract that you made with the seller does not fulfil those criteria. I think that is nice. So I say ‘thank you’ to the EU for that.</p>
<p class="contents">The Distance Selling Directive does not sound very nice either but it basically means that if you buy something on the internet, say from Germany, and, when you get it and it does not look like what you wanted, you can send the product back within seven days, and the purchase is refunded.</p>
<p class="contents">I also think that we should be a little bit better at marketing consumer protection. I will just give you one example from here. I agree with the following sentence but I am doing the sort of mother-in-law test here. What do you think my mother-in-law would say if she read this from the report’s explanatory statement: ‘The horizontal instrument would be based on maximum harmonisation, while the sectoral tools would continue to be based on the principle of minimum harmonisation with the exception of the directives already adopted on the basis of maximum harmonisation, such as the directive on unfair commercial practices’? I agree <span class="bold">–</span> no problem. However, if we are trying to deal with consumer protection, let us have some consumer protection on the stuff that we write as well.</p>
<p class="contents">My third and final point is this: I think the report is good but I think we could go even further. I am all for maximum harmonisation, at the end of the day. The funny thing is that we <span class="italic">always</span> claim that we have the best consumer protection in the world. I tell Mr Harbour that Finland has better consumer protection than the UK. He tells me: no, that is not the case at all. So I think we really need to find some kind of balance, and that is why I like your idea, as rapporteur on mutual recognition, to try to have some mutual recognition on this as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, I would like to congratulate Ms Patrie for a great report. I would like to congratulate the new, dynamic Commissioner for great work on the acquis. I think this is a good start, but we can go further. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would also like to thank Mrs Kuneva for her work on the Green Paper. Of course, consumer rules actually concern all political decisions. EU legislation and regulations affect Europe’s inhabitants and those inhabitants are consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">We Social Democrats in Europe are working hard to ensure that consumer protection remains the focus. We cannot have a smoothly functioning internal market without satisfied and safe consumers. The Community’s legislation is currently based on the principle of minimum harmonisation, which is actually natural as the Member States are at different stages of the journey as regards consumer protection, as we have heard today. I think that it is important for us to simplify and improve the regulatory regime, for both consumers and professionals, because this would facilitate cross-border trade and increase consumer confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">It is important, however, that the required harmonisation provides a high level of consumer protection and is carried out with caution. We should also decide on a consumer protection guarantee which means that no consumer will have worse protection than before harmonisation. I therefore urge you to vote in favour of the Social Democrats’ Amendments 4 and 10.</p>
<p class="contents">Lastly, I believe that the aim of reviewing consumer legislation in the EU must be to strengthen consumer protection, not to increase trade between Member States. Even though they go hand-in-hand, there is a big difference between allowing consumer protection to guide the work and focusing on commercial considerations. We must put people before the market. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

An information society needs to be underpinned by cast-iron permanent rules, however. Confidence is an essential feature of such a society, and confidence must be based on strong foundations.</p>
<p class="contents">This is true of all areas of European policy, and is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span> of issues relating to consumer rights, their protection and the related matter of security. The outcome of the consultation undertaken on the basis of the questions annexed to the Green Paper confirms this view. The citizens value their security greatly, and support for the greatest possible harmonisation of legislation stems from the desire to ensure security.</p>
<p class="contents">The facts quoted in the report give cause for concern. I would remind the House that over 70% of Europeans consider that cross-border transactions are likely to prove more problematic than local purchases. Half of all Europeans are wary of making cross-border purchases. These are everyday facts that may seem trivial from the perspective of large-scale politics. They are, however, of enormous importance to the citizens, in the context of their sense of unity and level of integration.</p>
<p class="contents">The next issue is a particularly burning one that cannot, in my view, be left to self-regulation. I refer to the protection of consumers involved in electronic commerce, known as e-commerce. I do of course recall that a Directive on e-commerce was adopted in June 2000, but we should also remember that seven years have passed since then. Please do not misunderstand me, but seven years is an eternity if you consider that the history of this practice only goes back about 15 years. Were we to be asked what has changed during that period we would have to reply ‘everything’. The terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 forced us to review our ideas on Internet security. The House will recall that advanced techniques were of course employed in the preparation of those attacks.</p>
<p class="contents">The views I have just put forward have a very specific bearing on the protection of consumers’ rights. Clear and secure methods of conducting transactions over the Internet are required. We should focus on implementing methods of safeguarding Internet transactions and making it impossible for unauthorised persons to gain access to consumers’ data. A relatively easy method would be to improve and standardise pan-European security standards for Internet transactions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that if we want our fellow citizens to see the internal market not just as a threat, we need to ensure that consumers are properly protected, especially since the internal market applies to complex products: I am of course thinking in this respect of the financial markets. Every day current events provide us with examples, if any were needed, of the extent to which consumer protection poses a challenge in that area.</p>
<p class="contents">In that regard, I would like to return to what Commissioner McCreevy said yesterday: he gave the impression that if the American real estate market was in the state it was in, it was because the people taking out mortgages had no financial education. Financial education is very important, but it must not take the place of real consumer protection, incorporated in all of our laws. That requires horizontal legislation as well as sectoral laws. We must not substitute education for consumer protection and the liability of professionals when offering products that circulate freely in the internal market.</p>
<p class="contents">My second point relates to collective redress. I think that our rapporteur in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr Sánchez Presedo, will comment on this, but I believe that we have to make progress in this area. No one in Europe ever imagined that we wanted to import the American model, but there is a difference between the situation that exists today in the EU’s internal market and the situation in the US, and I trust you, Commissioner, to do this intelligently from a European perspective. Is it normal today to have no knowledge, no transparency of the complaints that are lodged, the fines that are applied? Let us have a transparent and open debate on the reality of what these class actions recover and let us provide European consumers with this useful tool!</p>
<p class="contents">If you do not mind, Madam President, I have one last comment. The clear definitions of ‘consumer’ and ‘professional’ proposed in the report are important but we must be careful not to cause confusion: in the area of financial services, for example, the idea that certain products can be reserved for professionals is an illusion that could reduce the guarantees offered to consumers. Sooner or later these goods move around the market and are offered to all consumers. As a result, we should have a definition but it should not be the be all and end all of consumer protection! </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We are talking about better law-making. What we are really trying to do is give consumers confidence that, no matter where they shop, they will have the same rights. But we are not doing so well, because half of all our citizens are cautious about shopping across borders because they do not believe that they are going to be protected – and that is not surprising. I think it is easier to shop locally, and people are more comfortable with the local. But when you look at retailers, half of them want to do cross-border trading – and, in fact, 29% do so. Retailers believe that if there was better law in this area, consumers would do more shopping across borders.</p>
<p class="contents">Truthfully, consumers do not care if we have eight or twenty directives. In fact they do not even want to know about what is going on behind the scenes. They just want to feel comfortable and to know that there is simplicity in the law. And in case mothers-in-law were offended by Mr Stubb’s test, I think that if he read that paragraph to Members of this House, considering terms like ‘horizontal instruments’, ‘tools’, ‘cross-cutting’ etc., there would be very few who would clearly understand it either.</p>
<p class="contents">The real problem, as is pointed out in the report, is that there is fragmentation and uneven transposition of European law. I recently chaired a committee of inquiry into Equitable Life and we saw very clearly the problems of uneven transposition in the financial services area and the need for the Commission to improve its oversight. We made recommendations in that regard.</p>
<p class="contents">The truth is that the gap between what we agree here and what happens in Member States is too great. I want to see electronic commerce included in the scope of the review and other issues like distance marketing of financial services, consumer credit and unfair commercial practices.</p>
<p class="contents">Paragraph 49 is important and it recognises the need for ongoing consumer education. I think the network of consumer centres have a role to play here because two thirds of consumers say that they do not know where to get information and advice on cross-border shopping. That is simply too many people.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of redress and collective and class actions; I accept what is being said by Ms Wallis in this regard and I take on board as well her knowledge and wisdom in terms of law.</p>
<p class="contents">I want to mention two or three specific issues. European City Guide is a problem which is repeatedly coming up on my desk and your desk and yet nobody does anything. Unless we do something, consumers think all we do is talk about it and ignore the problem and you really need to take this on board. If the Member States are failing, get on to their case and make them take action.</p>
<p class="contents">In relation to toys and unsafe products; Mrs McCarthy has alluded to that. People believe that when they buy products in the European market, they are safe. In relation to Brazilian beef we have concerns about that too. So, there is, in this House, a gap between what we say and what we do, but this report is a very good first step in terms of improving consumer protection. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Increasing the safety and reliability of the market can reduce costs, boost the volume of transactions and attract investment; in short, it can help to achieve the objectives of the revised Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">The opinion of Parliament’s Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has stressed the importance of applying special consumer protection rules in the financial services sector and the need for an integrated, comprehensive and systematic approach in this area throughout the European Union. It has also emphasised that the review must be carried out with the participation of stakeholders, in accordance with the principles of good governance.</p>
<p class="contents">This approach is to a large extent reflected in the report, insofar as it advocates a comprehensive vision, a mixed or combined approach comprising a horizontal instrument and other sectoral instruments, and scrupulous application of the principles of better regulation.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer protection can eradicate undesirable practices and prevent the accumulation of imbalances that lead to major conflicts. Just yesterday we debated the situation caused by the mortgages given out in the United States to groups with limited resources, with high prices, in predatory circumstances and with irresponsible promotions.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial security and economic stability can be improved by ensuring free and informed consent on the part of consumers, with clear and adequate information and the opportunity to verify the reports on their financial situation and find out the relevant data, in order to receive impartial advice, and, where appropriate, reactive mechanisms including the use of collective redress, avoiding, of course, the excesses found in the US but clearly guaranteeing consumer protection.</p>
<p class="contents">An annual report of complaints and claims by the users of financial services could be a useful instrument alongside better education. Any progress in this area will be very positive. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is particularly relevant to the review of the consumer acquis, because thanks to deepening integration our societies have become more mobile. It is becoming increasingly frequent for European citizens to make purchases and use services in other Member States. Accordingly, it is very important to adopt this initiative so that consumers can feel confident that they enjoy the same degree of protection across the entire territory of the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the Commission’s proposal is well-balanced, because it ensures a high level of consumer protection whilst simultaneously supporting the competitiveness of Europe’s economy. It is not enough simply to put a set of standards of this nature in place: they have to be effective. That is why I am emphasising that the consumers and other entities within the internal market need to have legal certainty regarding their activities and operations on the market. The current regulations did not provide such certainty as they were not applied in a uniform manner across all the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In its Green Paper the European Commission is proposing modernisation, simplification and improvement of the law, with a view to achieving legal certainty. The rapporteur endorses this almost entirely in her report. I agree with the mixed approach proposed, involving the simplification of the eight Directives on consumer protection. The horizontal instrument should be based on maximum harmonisation, whilst the sectoral tools should comply with the principle of minimum harmonisation. I also share the Commission’s view that the principles relating to the right of cancellation and withdrawal should be modernised and ought to be defined in terms of calendar days. In addition, I support the Commission’s call for the introduction of a standard withdrawal form to be used in all Member States. This would help to simplify procedures involving small enterprises and consumers whilst also raising the level of implementation of the principles of information.</p>
<p class="contents">I am also delighted that it has proved possible to develop definitions of ‘consumer’ and ‘professional’, and that the definitions are sound. I believe that the horizontal instrument contains many helpful indications regarding modernisation of the Community acquis. In the area of consumer rights and with regard to contractual clauses, it is a good idea to draw up a black list of terms that would be unfair in all circumstances. It is in the joint interests of all users of the internal market that this report be adopted and the relevant acquis reviewed. The report contains many provisions worthy of consideration. It is a sound report, and congratulations are due to the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Europa should be built on the citizen's social agenda. We often cite telephone, transport, financial, medical, and educational services. We need to define quality criteria for public services. We cannot develop the European economy if the public transport between two towns does not exist because it is not cost effective. The new regulation on roaming is a success.</p>
<p class="contents">Consumer protection also means that every EU citizen or family has the necessary daily basket ensured. How can we protect the retired, how can we protect the disabled people or the vulnerable people in an internal market if it relies only on economic criteria?</p>
<p class="contents">Despite the legislation in force, EU citizens, as consumers, do not know how -and implicitly are unable- to defend their rights. Passengers do not know that theycan do -and implicitly do not request financial compensation in case of delay or cancellation of flights. I hope that these compensation schemes will be introduced also for other transport means.</p>
<p class="contents">I also welcome the rapporteur’s request to draw up a black list of the forbidden clauses and a grey list of the alleged forbidden clauses that may arise when concluding contracts. Besides, it is imperative that citizens, as consumers, be better informed.</p>
<p class="contents">How do we protect a participant in an investment fund from the shareholder’s decision to invest in business types the participant does not agree with?

<p class="contents">I am also glad that many European citizens are listening to this very important matter for our everyday lives – the so-called ‘Green Paper’, which perhaps sounds a little distant. But when you realise that we are surrounded by consumer contracts, starting early in the morning when we buy a cup of coffee – this is already a consumer contract – you can see how important what we are debating today is to the citizens’ agenda of the European Union. I am very grateful that you are all so dedicated to making the language really understandable and close to the citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me start with a few remarks about the general issues you touched upon. Firstly, concerning the scope of the review: I am very sympathetic towards a more open review of the acquis, but we have already stipulated that the Commission agrees that it should, in principle, be limited to the eight directives covered by the Green Paper. So any legislative follow-up instrument would need to clarify its relationship with other Community instruments.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will evaluate the need for and the timing of a report on the e-commerce Directive. I fully agree, when we are talking about means for European consumers, that it is very important to tackle this issue, but this does not really fall within the scope of this review. Normally, I am very ambitious as a politician and as the Commissioner for Consumer Protection, but I do not believe that we can include the e-commerce Directive within the scope of this revision at the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of consumer protection directives, such as Directive 97/7/EC on the protection of consumers in respect of distance contracts, applies to consumer contracts concluded by electronic means and, indeed, the e-commerce Directive clearly states that it is without prejudice to the level of protection for consumer interests as established by Community acts, including the consumer acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">In this respect, the e-commerce Directive can be reviewed separately from the review of the consumer acquis, and I assure you that I will follow this subject very closely with fellow Commissioner McCreevy, within whose portfolio lies the e-commerce Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">I also believe that we have achieved a good understanding within the Commission that the consumer dimension should be seen in many other portfolios, not just within the portfolio of the Commissioner for Consumer Protection. So I am involved in the third energy package, which will be produced by the end of this month; I am also involved with the internal market review, and Commissioner McCreevy and are co-authors on the financial services review. I will not drop the very important consumer dimension from my attention. We also see, from INFSO, the success of the work related to the enhanced consumer confidence in roaming, and this is just the beginning.</p>
<p class="contents">Many of you have referred to the level of consumer protection. Let me reiterate that the Commission’s emphasis on proposals for full harmonisation will be based on a high level of consumer protection. A ‘race to the bottom’ approach is therefore clearly excluded. However, it is not anticipated that such proposals would be based on the highest level of consumer protection, which has been achieved by some national legislations. I agree with Ms Wallis that we should have an accessible and understandable set of rules, which means that we will look at how we can implement these rules in all the 27 Member States. This issue will definitely not be ‘raced to the bottom’.</p>
<p class="contents">With due respect to those Member States that exercise best practice, believe me, there is no ideal country in respect to consumer protection. I have visited half the Member States. I took stock from the most advanced countries and, again, some of them failed to transpose the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices. I will show you the scoreboard on the implementation of the Directive on Unfair Commercial Practices and you will be surprised that even the champions of consumer protection failed in the transposition of this particular directive.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the common frame of reference (CFR), as Ms Wallis knows, this project is dear to my heart and the Commission agrees with the European Parliament on the need to ensure coherence between the work on the preparation of the CFR and the review of the consumer acquis. As the European Parliament correctly points out, it is essential that the review of the acquis is not delayed by CFR work, which is a more long-term project. I look forward to working on this issue to take more stock of what is the experience, seminar after seminar, but I believe that the Green Paper is a test. If we achieve the targeted full harmonisation through the Green Paper, this promises that we can work on a good common contractual base for the future. I really believe in the future of this project.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards the need to ensure effective publication of consumer protection rules and adequate information to consumers – points 42, 43 and 47 – the Commission underlines that the recent initiatives in this area are expected to yield results in the near future.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to draw attention to point 6; the application of the future instrument, once adopted, would have to be evaluated in order to assess its effectiveness. This is very important for better regulation, because, if the best designed legislation remains on paper, it will disappoint citizens, it will be just paper, and we will provoke a more cynical approach towards the efforts of the Commission and of Parliament, so enforcement and implementation scoreboards are really very important.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is sure that any future proposal following up the Green Paper consultation will be preceded by a thorough impact assessment in accordance with the applicable internal guidelines, also as a part of a better regulation process.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to refer for a while to collective redress, which is very important. I do not know with what kind of words I could reassure those who are still hesitant that this is not an American-type of class action. I do not know how these allegations began, that what we are trying to introduce is the American class action; maybe I need to speak <span class="italic">ex cathedra</span> and make a solemn oath. No, this is not an American class action. This is our attempt to answer to the needs of the European citizens. In November there will be a very interesting conference during the Portuguese Presidency on collective redress and, please, if you would like to be instrumental in our future attempts, let us not use the term ‘class action’. We are talking about collective redress. By the way, in 14 European Member States, we have collective redress, representative action and group action, as in France etc. Fortunately, businesspeople are coming around more and more to the idea of collective redress.</p>
<p class="contents">I had a very interesting meeting recently with the <span class="italic">Mouvement des Entreprises de France</span>. I was invited there for a big conference, and we are starting to come closer in our positions, so I believe that if we do our work properly, making sure, in a very open and sincere manner, what we are targeting with collective redress, we will finally reach a common solution. I personally believe in it.</p>
<p class="contents">Financial capability and services – an absolutely good and proper point. The Commission recently held a conference on financial capability issues to generate ideas on what it can do in this area. The Commission will come forward with a communication on this subject later this year, in which it will set out its views and announce initiatives to encourage and promote the provision of financial education in the Member States. Again, let me reiterate that I will join my efforts to Commissioner McCreevy’s report on financial services and I will keep the agenda of consumer protection, the citizens’ market, very close to the outcome.</p>
<p class="contents">Now to specific issues raised in the Green Paper. I would like to refer to some of them. Digital content and software: the Commission agrees that this issue requires further reflection. As you know, we supported Ms Roithová’s report. I think this is one of the possible avenues for doing important things right now to raise awareness, but the Commission will launch an information-gathering process in order to determine whether consumers suffer detriment as a result of the lack of coverage of digital content and software. This process will be separated from the general follow-up to the Green Paper.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning the issue of prolonging the time limit for the legal guarantee, some of you pointed out how important the liability and guarantee is as a process of consumer protection. The Commission considers that future reflection is required, but takes note of the support for this issue by many respondents to the consultation. Furthermore, the Commission agrees with the suggestion to maintain the current rules of the burden of proof or the lack of conformity.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission takes note of the European Parliament’s opposition to the introduction of direct producers’ liability. Further reflection is needed on this issue in view of the mixed views amongst the stakeholders.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall refer now to collective redress. This issue has been raised in Ms Patrie’s report and by Ms Wallis as well. I agree with Ms Wallis concerning the need to ensure coherence between the work on the preparation of CFR and the review of the consumer acquis, that we will maintain the same speed. You can rely on my commitment, Ms Wallis, that I will not miss an opportunity to speak about the importance of the CFR in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lechner also mentioned quite promptly how important coherence is. It is definitely part of my agenda to assure coherence on the issue of consumer acquis.</p>
<p class="contents">Concerning Ms Kallenbach’s remarks on toys: I hope that, on 12 September, if I am not mistaken, at the next meeting of the Committee on the Internal Market and Consumer Protection, I will have more opportunity to talk about the action taken by the Commission. I think that we already have some concrete results to discuss. I went to China; this problem has not caught us by surprise. We have our RAPEX system, which is an excellent example of solidarity within the Union, to inform all 27 countries rapidly if a dangerous product is found on our markets. It works well. I made quite a strong point when I went to China – immediately after the visit, the two licences were withdrawn from the Chinese producers of the toys. Yesterday, I had a long conversation on the phone with Mr Eckert, who is CEO of Mattel.</p>
<p class="contents">I think that the toys issue and China could be used in explaining why it is so important to have targeted full harmonisation. It is not enough if consumers are well protected in one country. We cannot live in islands and this is definitely not the internal market and this is definitely not a united European Union. Believe me, it is very hard, even the biggest country in the Union, to convince China to act. If we would really like to have a stronger voice in our talks with China, we need to remain absolutely united with a clear set of rules, not 27 different markets, and also to follow very much enforcement. The consumer acquis is not the only one tool. We should see the entire picture. The acquis is definitely very important; it is the base and our foundation. But we also have our consumer strategy for 2007-2013, and we put a lot of effort into making sure that the enforcement is equally well respected everywhere. We have our consumer protection cooperation regulation, and at the end of September I invited all the consumer protection authorities to discuss some of the issues and the dangerous goods from the Chinese toy factories. I will come back to you and report on our stocktaking.</p>
<p class="contents">Also, the European consumer centre networks are very instrumental and complementary to what we are achieving as a good legislative base that should be implemented. Just to refer now to European City Guide. Yes, I receive a lot of letters about European City Guide. Unfortunately, on the basis of my prerogatives as Commissioner for Consumer Protection, I cannot do a lot. I will open my blog with a warning to citizens not to use such kinds of malpractices and be aware of European City Guide’s malpractices, but this is in the hands of the Member States to implement the possible protection.</p>
<p class="contents">Enforcement will be very much a key effort in the next months. I wrote personally to all my counterparts in the Member State Governments to make them aware that unfortunately we are not doing well with transposition of the Directive on unfair commercial practices. Twenty-seven of my counterparts received personal letters to make them aware that things are not going well. If we fail with transposition of the acquis, this is a very unstable ground for the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The question of Rome I has been raised by Ms Wallis and Mr Lechner. I can assure you, at this stage, that I do not see any inconsistency between the proposed Rome I regulation and an act which would fully harmonise some aspects of consumer protection or introduce a mutual recognition clause for the other aspects. But I am at your disposal to continue our discussion on this point. I know how sensitive it is from the point of view of our consistent efforts in making the legislative base for the Union coherent.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, once more, to thank all of you. I believe, Ms Patrie, that you have received a lot of recognition for your hard work. Let me finish by thanking you and saying that I look forward to continuing our work on this very important subject. Finally, thank you to the European citizens witnessing this debate. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The directive on passenger car taxation follows the same route. Unfortunately a Council decision is still pending from 2005, although both the Parliament and the European Economic and Social Committee gave their favourable opinion last autumn. This paper is absolutely necessary as, currently, 16 Member States impose a tax at 16 different levels, and this is a barrier for buying a passenger car from another EU Member State. In most cases, citizens who change their residence from one Member State to another who applying for registration tax happen to pay it twice.</p>

<p class="contents">The increase in international trade and greater mobility within the EU heighten the danger of international outbreaks of infectious diseases within the EU or their transmission to Europe from more distant continents. The response to such epidemics, using defensive methods, must be integrated and coordinated if it is to be effective. Today in the European Union we have the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC): combating mass epidemics is part of its duty. At the same time the Member States are members of the World Health Organisation, which has issued the International Health Regulations: they also deal with the fight against diseases that can spread from one country to another one.</p>
<p class="contents">There is a Commission Decision on the early warning and response system for the prevention and control of communicable diseases. The EU also has a few financial tools at its disposal, for example the European Union Solidarity Fund and the action programme for public health as a new instrument for early warning and response in the case of serious emergencies. At the same time, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, the Member States have control over their health services.</p>
<p class="contents">Given this complex system of abundant legislation at several levels, it will be difficult to respond quickly and unanimously if there is an epidemic risk. The EU and Member State systems need to be better connected so that we do not find ourselves in a situation whereby we have European legislation that will not match the preparedness of the Member States to respond quickly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Twenty years ago infectious diseases were not perceived as a major threat. Today they pose a risk and a challenge for every country. Threats such as pandemic influenza, malaria and tuberculosis are a health risk because of virus mutations, increasing resistance to antibiotics and weak health systems.</p>
<p class="contents">The new health risks also include foodborne diseases, chemical, biological or nuclear accidents or attacks, industrial pollution and climate change. These threats could endanger the lives of millions of people in several countries.</p>
<p class="contents">The spread of globalisation and increasing international flows and trade are aggravating factors. International collaboration to control infectious diseases is therefore vital. To this end, it is essential to eliminate any unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade.</p>
<p class="contents">This report provides an additional incentive for the Member States to develop further joint actions based on the exchange of good practices. The introduction of early warning systems in the case of serious pandemics in neighbouring countries and third countries is equally crucial. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One notable consequence of the current warming of the planet is that it dries out springs through evaporation and reduces the flow of the water level of rivers and of the underground water basins, thereby destroying the superficial structure of soil. According to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), desertification currently affects approximately 25% to 30% of the world’s land surface area, and between 1.2 billion and 2 billion people in at least 100 states are at risk. At a global level desertification is increasing, leading to poverty, forced migration and conflict.

The consequence is increased poverty, forced migration and conflict. One most graphic example is Darfur, where desertification has driven a complex conflict between pastoralists and farmers, as the farmers have been driven eastwards onto the land of the latter with the generation of hundreds of thousands of refugees, rapes, mayhem and murder. Only strong and urgent international action can stop Darfur from being the first of many more similar conflicts, whose underlying cause is desertification. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">There is also no doubt that these negative consequences are being felt both in the countries directly affected and in neighbouring countries. At the very least for this reason, given that the European Union must bear in mind that it borders areas undergoing a desertification process, the next EU-Africa summit must tackle this issue conscientiously and consistently.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, on another level definitely worth mentioning, the issue of desertification is also relevant within the European Union itself.

<p class="contents">Safeguarding the sustainability of resources by implementing long-term plans and short-term measures must without question involve an assessment of their socio-economic consequences and, as a result, the provision of financial resources guaranteeing the continued existence of vessels, employment and income in the industry and for fishermen. In our opinion, this is the relationship which best expresses and which must be at the root of the application of the maximum sustainable yield principle.</p>
<p class="contents">In other words, the ‘maximum sustainable yield’ must not be used as an instrument to promote (even further) the scrapping of vessels and the destruction of jobs.</p>
<p class="contents">The plans and measures for ensuring the sustainability of resources must be based on scientific fisheries research, not forgetting other measures which take account of the consequences of natural factors and those stemming from human activities with an impact on marine ecosystems. This is why we proposed the introduction in the report of the need to increase the appropriations earmarked for scientific fisheries research in the Seventh Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development.</p>

The country is often called a paradise for tourists, but is far from a paradise for the people living there. The last provocation by the ruling regime against its citizens was last month’s 500 percent increase in fuel prices. No wonder such a decision has evoked dissatisfaction and public protests, which have been, and are still being, brutally suppressed. Scores of protesters were beaten and arrested, and in order to realise the extent to which this regime suppresses its citizens and what it is capable of, one needs only to remember the events of 1988, the situation of the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991, the attempt on her life in 2003, and the fact that, since 1996, the regime has destroyed more than 3 000 villages and carried out the forced removal of more than one million people. Extraordinary brutality is characteristic of this regime; its catalogue of crimes includes rape, torture, forced labour and the use of child soldiers. All this is undoubtedly seen by the international community and we should not allow recent events to develop into larger scale repressions.</p>
<p class="contents">The crimes and human rights violations by the ruling regime in Burma deserve our severe condemnation. We express our solidarity with the people of Burma and demand that the arrested protesters be released immediately and that http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1991 be allowed to live a rewarding life and have freedom of action. Today a heavy responsibility also falls on certain countries in this region, such as China and India, which have the potential to exercise their influence in order to reach a settlement of the conflict in Burma in a civilised way.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This has unfortunately not happened: although the human rights infringements in Burma have changed to some extent they have actually deteriorated significantly. The expulsion of the International Red Cross is highly symbolic in this respect, showing that this is a totally intolerable regime. However, what we in the European Union must look at is our policy towards such infringements: it is hard to believe that in seven years we have not had a summit with Africa on Zimbabwe, where there is an extremely violent regime that is failing to respect human rights. However, when it comes to Burma, the same cannot be said: obviously the commercial interests in Asia are much more important than those in Africa!

Burma has been under a totalitarian military regime for 45 years. An ex-British colony, Burma has suffered a traumatic post-colonial period, which has been fertile ground for the firm establishment of a military junta.</p>
<p class="contents">Since 1962, army generals have ruled the country and the Burmese people have endured severe abuses of their human rights. Furthermore, the generals, through their incompetence, have made Burma one of Asia’s poorest countries and a nation in which corruption has assumed gigantic proportions. In addition, Burma has become a cancerous infliction on the rest of the world by being heavily involved in the large-scale trafficking of heroin, with Burma being a major exporter of this deadly drug.</p>
<p class="contents">The power figure in Burma today is General Than Shwe, a person of dubious psychological stability, who is reported to be maliciously introverted and superstitious and who frequently takes important state decisions after consulting astrologers. Yet Burma is a country gifted with unparallel natural beauty, a uniquely fertile land and rich mineral resources, as well as significant oil and gas deposits. All of these have been the centre of attraction for foreign investors. But, sadly, the benefits of such investments have not reached the people of Burma, and have largely ended up in the pockets of the dictators and their collaborators.</p>
<p class="contents">A hope for return to democratic governing was heard in 1990 when the National League for Democracy (NLD) won a national election. But the General suppressed all attempts at democratisation and the NDL leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, not only was prevented from assuming power but was also placed under house arrest, and this despite an international outcry.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma has been the subject of human rights resolutions by this House on numerous occasions in the past, and some sanctions have been in place for years. But it has all been in vain, mainly because the Burmese ruling regime enjoys the support of China. The truth is that if we really want to effect democratic changes in Burma, we must direct our blame and our attention at the Chinese Government. We can put pressure on the Chinese, e.g. by threatening them with trade sanctions and an investment embargo on China. If we are brave enough to do that, then we stand a chance of changing things for the better in Burma. If not, then I fear this resolution, like all the previous ones, will end up in General Than Shwe’s dustbin. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

If we listed all the many countries, societies and nations that have breached human rights and are consequently the subject of our debates they would amount to a substantial proportion of our planet. It should be noted that breaches of human rights do not arise only in poor counties. They also often happen in developing countries that may not be particularly wealthy but are in the process of developing, like Russia. Some of these countries even legitimise themselves through democratic elections. Breaches of human rights may also occur in countries like China, which is moving rapidly up the world wealth ratings. At the same time we also have to deal with the poorest countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, I believe we should consider whether we ought to forego our debate on one occasion and ask the European Commission to present ideas for tackling breaches of human rights across the world. I make this proposal because we discuss these breaches Thursday after Thursday, we are forever complaining, but what comes of it all. Human rights violations obviously lead to a tangled web of consequences. It should be stated that one such consequence concerns the cooperation between various large financial and economic institutions that are generally perfectly legal and the criminal regimes in power in the countries concerned.</p>
<p class="contents">It has emerged that there is a group of large financial corporations that collaborates with various bigwigs and local dictators to oppress their own people. Sadly, it is often the case that those countries were better off during colonial times. True, they were governed by the colonial powers, but criminal links between large foreign financial entities and local regimes were less common. As Mr Matsakis has rightly pointed out, there are links of this sort in Burma, to name but one example. Should something be done about that? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The reason, of course, lies in the lack of democracy – although the situation in the three countries of course varies considerably in this respect – and in the exploitation of the population and, above all, the human rights abuses of every kind. The contents of the recitals in this first resolution on Burma are especially shocking. Indeed, they are horrific and, for us as privileged Europeans, they should be a wake-up call. The abuses inflicted by this military regime on individuals, and especially on the various minorities – I would like to mention the Karen people in particular here – are hair-raising. We cannot simply look away.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add something that is not really highlighted in this motion. The Greens are very pleased to support the contents of this motion because it is entirely justified in social policy terms and from a human rights perspective. However, I believe that the environmental disasters resulting from this military regime should also be emphasised rather more forcefully. I would like to give you an example: there are plans to build a massive dam, which will result in 10 million people – just think about that for a moment – having to be resettled. The activities of this military regime can only be countered by the most stringent joint measures by the EU, the UN and the nations of the world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We find ourselves today having to strongly react, once again, to the unacceptable actions of the military junta in Burma. Our last urgency resolution on Burma was only in June. The recent crackdown on peaceful protesters, who were demonstrating their right to associate, has merited yet another condemnation by the European Parliament. The scant regard the ruling State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has for its own people has become all the more evident with their recent imposition of a fuel price increase of 500%. The SPDC clearly wants to further impoverish its people. But Burmese civilians have shown unbridled bravery in coming out to demonstrate. Not only were demonstrators beaten violently by police, but multiple arrests were made and members of the 88 Generation Students group have been reimprisoned. I call for the immediate and unconditional release of all those who have been detained since protests began as well as Aung San Suu Kyi, probably the world’s most famous imprisoned democratic leader. Furthermore, the new constitution, recently drafted by the National Convention in Burma, is a sham given the simple reason that no democratically elected members of the opposition were involved in the drafting process. This Parliament now leads the call for an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council to consider the recent events in Burma. We need a strong and binding resolution on Burma at this level, as this crisis now impacts upon the overall security of this region. Countries like China and Russia, who prevented the adoption of the last UN Security Council resolution on Burma and China of this year, need to play a more responsible role regarding this country and should lend their support to any future UN resolution.</p>
<p class="contents">All that is necessary for the triumph of evil is that good men do nothing. The international community is doing little, while the Burma junta is perpetrating atrocities against its own people. How long can we justify allowing this evil to reign? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Human rights have been infringed in that country for many years. There is widespread persecution, not only of pro-democracy activists but also of the rest of the population, 30% of which is living on the verge of poverty. People are being obliged to carry out forced labour and are being forcibly resettled.</p>
<p class="contents">This time the protests and persecution intensified following a 500% rise in the cost of fuel due to the government withdrawing its subsidy. Organisations defending human rights are sending out alarming information on the arrest of some 100 activists and the illegal detention of Mrs Aung San Suu Kyi, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, for yet another year.</p>
<p class="contents">We support the resolutions. They will not, however, have any impact on the situation in Burma. The regime currently in power there does not react to any pressure, and more radical measures are therefore required. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When we discussed the resolution on Burma in the PPE-DE Group yesterday, we came to the conclusion that the motion for a resolution is very good but the situation in Burma is very bad. I am sure many of us would like things to be the other way around and the situation in Burma to be such that we were not required to adopt a resolution of any kind.</p>
<p class="contents">In Burma the army is pacifying regions inhabited by ethnic minorities. The army regularly arrests opposition activists and it harasses ordinary citizens protesting against price increases and the further reduction of what is already a horrifyingly low standard of living. What can we do about this? The European Council should carry out a detailed study of the weaknesses of the sanctions system with a view to the latter becoming a really useful and effective weapon in the war against the political regime in Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">It is essential to exert further pressure on China and Russia so that the situation in Burma can eventually be discussed at the United Nations Security Council. In addition, we should make every effort to ensure that EU aid, which will amount to EUR 65 million over the next few years, should go directly to the citizens of Burma and not serve to support the regime. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Like all the previous speakers, we view with regret the crackdown on the peaceful demonstrations, which were directed against the massive fuel price increase of 500%. This fuel price increase resulted in a doubling of transport costs and massive price rises for essential goods and services, all against the backdrop of disastrous social conditions in Burma, where 90% of the population lives below the poverty line and survives on less than one dollar a day, and one child in three under the age of five suffers from severe malnutrition.</p>
<p class="contents">We view with regret the violent assaults on civilians, the particularly brutal attacks on women and the detention of more than 100 people, and call for their immediate and unconditional release, including the release of the leaders of the 88 Generation Students group.

This latest extended and illegal house arrest of an innocent woman is unacceptable. Burma is effectively a prison country which operates under a repressive system of military rule.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma has been designated a country of particular concern by the US for violating religious freedom. The Burmese military closely monitors and restricts organisations, activity and expression of all religions because they view them as threats to so-called ‘national unity’. In particular, abuses against Christians in Burma are widespread and systematic. Christians suffer a deliberate campaign of discrimination in their work, restrictions on churches, meetings and literature and the arrest, torture and imprisonment of pastors and church workers. Burma’s military regime has no moral or legal justification for their activities of any type.</p>
<p class="contents">Such human rights abuses cannot continue. We, in Europe, need to stand up to military powers like Burma, regardless of the trade advantage with Burma or their patrons like China; otherwise our resolutions will remain ineffective. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the military regime is a threat to the region and, most of all, to the country and the people of Burma.</p>
<p class="contents">A large part of the population of 52 million is in anguish and poverty, which is the result of bad political and economic governance.</p>
<p class="contents">In an environment of political, social and economic insecurity, issues of human rights are sadly taking backstage, and the most recent detention of political activists is a case in point.</p>
<p class="contents">The overriding challenge for the Government – national reconciliation and economic development – is obvious. But for the international community, helping the transition of Burma towards being a more open and more developed society to be led by a legitimate and civilian government must remain the paramount goal.</p>
<p class="contents">The National Convention process, which has just finished, was a very formal procedure to boost the current regime’s power. It was certainly not a genuine exercise to draft a new constitution and was far from inclusive. That is why the Commission fully shares the view of the United States Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has requested the Government embark on an inclusive, participatory and transparent process, with a view to allowing all the relevant parties to Myanmar’s national reconciliation process to fully contribute to defining the country’s future.</p>
<p class="contents">We also welcome the work of Ibrahim Gambari, as Special Envoy for Myanmar of the United Nations Secretary-General. We hope that the good offices of the United Nations will continue. Professor Gambari is due to visit Myanmar shortly.</p>
<p class="contents">We criticise, specifically, the working conditions in the country for the Red Cross. The Government, in its own interests and out of respect for international humanitarian law, should allow the International Committee of the Red Cross to continue its mission.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, we should note a few encouraging signals. The Commission hopes that the recent arrangement between the Government of Burma and the ILO, handling the complaints against forced labour, will help the victims. We acknowledge that the Government has agreed in early August with its ASEAN partners to the inclusion of a human rights commission in the planned ASEAN Charter, the constitutional document.</p>
<p class="contents">What can the EU do? An effective policy should aim at bringing the country back into the international community, allowing for political, social and economic development. The EU common position reflects this need; it is a balanced document, detailing our criticisms, while engaging Government over its responsibilities and offering assistance to the people.</p>
<p class="contents">As regards engaging the regime, there is a consensus that more needs to be done, not less. Isolation will only make the population pay a greater price. The Commission maintains that channels of communication with the Government must be kept open, notably to convey our concerns about human rights and, in this regard, the Commission uses all appropriate occasions, for instance the ASEM meetings, and the EU ASEAN meetings, to raise the need for an inclusive dialogue among all stakeholders. We regularly press for national reconciliation and for the liberation of political detainees.</p>
<p class="contents">To help the people of Myanmar, and specifically the most vulnerable parts of the population, the Commission is increasing its assistance programmes in quantitative and in qualitative terms. A new country strategy foresees support for health and basic education, for instance the Three Diseases Fund, which is supported by the EU and its partner, is already working well to fights AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. This comes on top of our significant humanitarian aid.</p>
<p class="contents">In particular, as foreseen in the EU common position, the European Union wishes to engage the Government in a critical dialogue over its responsibilities to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, and the Commission hopes that the Government is prepared to step up the existing dialogue in areas of health and education, among others. Unfortunately, we do not believe that additional restrictive measures will push the Government in the desired direction or will alleviate the suffering of the people. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A military junta placed the party’s leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, under house arrest. In 2007 Myanmar’s Peace and Development Council continues its oppression. Aung San Suu, who was elected leader in Burma’s elections, remains under arrest.</p>
<p class="contents">Burma is an example of how, as long as the will of the people is suppressed by means of house arrest and imprisonment, society suffers. Human rights and legal order do not prevail. Ninety per cent of the people live below the poverty line. The country’s dwindling economy and poor humanitarian record worsened again this year when Myanmar’s junta raised fuel prices in August.</p>
<p class="contents">In the quest for a solution the EU’s role is prominent in the United Nations Security Council and the Human Rights Council. The European Member States must show strength and take responsibility for the plight of the Burmese people.</p>
<p class="contents">The keys to the solution, however, are mainly in the hands of China, Russia and India. China has already exercised its right of veto in the Security Council and blocked a resolution on Burma. A highly regarded position in the international community does not come free. It has to be earned.</p>
<p class="contents">Attempts by the West to enforce a rapid democratisation of despotic regimes in the world have failed. It has been said that democracy is not a product that can be exported. Some have thought it to be the white man’s illusion. People have asked whether rule by the people is even the right way to govern a country. Is it a suitable option everywhere?</p>
<p class="contents">The problem with the world, however, is not that democracy should be won with fire and sword. The problem is that it is suppressed with fire and sword. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table>

It became a nation only in 1971 following years of civil war which involved neighbouring ex-British colonies, Pakistan and India. Bangladesh suffered 15 years of military dictatorship and, although civilian government was restored in 1990, the country is far from having a true democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, it is a very poor nation plagued by widespread corruption, political interference by the military, severe abuses of human rights, bans on political activities, discrimination against women, religious extremism and a long list of other evils, some of which are mentioned in the resolution. Yet, as is stated clearly in Recital N: ‘the EU and Bangladesh have good long-lasting relations and are important economic partners’. This is true, but so much for choosing our friends and partners and so much for being successful in helping such friendly nations to improve their state of prosperity, their level of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">In fairness, the EU has tried to improve things in Bangladesh, but has it tried hard enough? Has the aid given to Bangladesh been directed properly at improving the nation’s productivity infrastructure or has it been deviated into the pockets of corrupt officials? Has the pressure on the military to stop interfering with the nation’s political life been severe and determined enough, or has it been weak and ineffective?</p>
<p class="contents">One can provide one’s own answers to these questions. However, my view is that we are a long way from doing what is necessary; there is an urgent need to review our policy on Bangladesh, not excluding the implementation of sanctions and certainly including the serving of stern warnings to neighbouring Pakistan and India to resist the temptation of interfering in the internal affairs of Bangladesh. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Bangladesh is a large and strategic South Asian country, and once again regrettably is in the news with the August student demonstrations and the arrest of three former prime ministers in a process aimed at combating corruption, but unfortunately and perversely having the appearance of attempting to stifle the democratic, albeit deeply divided, political classes.</p>
<p class="contents">The caretaker government has reassured the EU and the USA that it will proceed to democratic elections at the end of 2008, once the electoral registration process is completed and robust enough against electoral fraud. However, the timescale appears very long, and there are suspicions that the military, whose profile politically has recently risen, are keen to radically alter the political complexion of the country by removing from circulation the two warring protagonists, ex-prime ministers Sheikh Hasina and Khaleda Zia. It is difficult to understand why they are not released on bail pending trial, and furthermore why the initial arrests were so melodramatic and lacking in due process under the emergency powers – which this resolution rightly calls for to be lifted, as well as calling for EU diplomatic observers to be present at the two ladies’ trials.</p>
<p class="contents">Certainly, Western aid donors are watching Bangladesh very carefully, given the concerns about the deteriorating human rights situation over the last few years and also increasing Islamist radicalisation of its society and a departure, very sadly, from its original course of secular multi-party democracy – a model we in the EU should strongly continue to support for that country. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Having heard about all these individual cases we are bound to wonder how such a situation can exist in a world that is increasingly subject to so-called globalisation, that is networked by economic organisations and even more so by political ones, a world that has seen the establishment of the United Nations and of the European Union on our own continent, and a world where there are so many organisations claiming to respect human beings. We might well ask ourselves why globalisation of fundamental humanitarian principles has not taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">It seems to be a problem affecting our times and our organisations. Everyone is interested in politics and economics, but when it comes to giving politics and economics a human dimension, so that no further harm is done to humble ordinary people, we appear to be helpless.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner Reding said a moment ago while we were discussing Burma that there is a danger that we will becomes helpless again and fail to react against these injustices. We need to understand, however, that certain steps have to be taken and that there is an imbalance between the scale of our political activities, our economic activities and the extent of compliance with standard fundamental rights.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to draw attention to another issue. In the declaration reference is made to the emergence of persecution for religious reasons amongst others. I should like to point out that religious persecution is generally, though not always, directed against Christians, notably Catholics. At a global level, Catholics are currently the group most frequently persecuted and killed for their faith. We should stick to the facts and when we refer to persecution we should remember who is persecuting whom. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It has religious freedom, women in rural areas have access to microcredit and we could see a local economy beginning to develop.</p>
<p class="contents">These positive trends have been quickly reversed, however, in a country where terror is spreading. In order to tackle corruption, according to the government, journalists, lawyers, political actors and student activists are being imprisoned. If I may say, putting everyone in prison is a bad way to tackle corruption, to say the least. We promise that we will help Bangladesh on the path to democracy and there must be a will on the part of the government.</p>
<p class="contents">Before I finish, I want to raise something that is in the resolution, but which perhaps not many will talk about and which I think is important, as I have spent a lot of time with people in slums. There were people in the old regime, in the ruling class, who took land, but when the government attempted to take back that land, millions of poor people, poor peasants and people in slums were evicted from their homes, from the last small shred of hope of survival which they had through a small piece of land. We must also think of these people when we are fighting for democracy in Bangladesh, as they have the least voice of all. They have the least power of all. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We cannot abandon Bangladesh at this stage. We must send observers with a broad remit.

They should press first and foremost for independent institutions and political parties in Bangladesh to be allowed to resume their activities.

After all, we have seen the present regime attempting to silence the legitimate political protest of students and journalists through arbitrary arrests and detentions. Since the new government took over in January 2007 more than 250 000 people have already been locked up. Since the declaration of the state of emergency, the army has been responsible for countless cases of torture and murder.</p>
<p class="contents">However, I would really like to expose another issue, an issue that is endemic in that state and that carries on regardless of changes of government. It is something that is often neglected by all kinds of human rights organisations, because evidently it is something that simply cannot be spoken about. I am talking about the wholesale and systematic gang rape that takes place in Bangladesh. The violence against women and young girls is one of the most heinous violations of human rights in that Islamic state. This kind of violence encompasses sexual and domestic violence, gang rape, throwing acid over women and honour killings. Whether or not people want to hear about it, it is undeniable that by means of these atrocities extremist Muslims want to cleanse Bangladesh of its religious minorities in order to transform the country into a monolithic, Islamic state. Every government of Bangladesh has failed to act and this is a downright disgrace. Bangladesh ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women in 1984. It is high time that Parliament sent out a very clear signal to the Bangladeshi Government to inform it of its responsibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In January the activity of democracy was suspended with the support of the military in a country whose two main parties, in the only example of its kind in the world, are led by women.</p>
<p class="contents">I admit that combating coercion and corruption is important for an effective economy and politics, although dirty methods such as suppressing demonstrations, gagging the press and undermining fair judicial proceedings may not be employed to that end. For nearly twenty-five years Bangladesh has been moving towards the European model. Secularism, hand in hand with religious tolerance, human rights and freedom of speech are values which our Parliament supports with all possible means.</p>
<p class="contents">We should therefore do all we can to put Bangladesh back on the road of democracy. The technical assistance to organise elections and the bipartite working groups are the least the European Union can do.

The European Union, by the way, has a commendable history of constructive engagement on human rights and democracy with Bangladesh, and the decision to send an EU election observation mission to scrutinise the abortive 2007 elections and to suspend the mission in the face of the Awami League boycott and compelling evidence of efforts to rig the polls, is an example of that engagement.</p>
<p class="contents">In the wake of the formation of the military-backed caretaker Government and the declaration of a state of emergency in January 2007, the EU has sought to balance strong support for a return to democracy in 2008 with the rigorous monitoring of the human rights situation. This is reflected in the European Commission’s intention to extend substantial support, alongside eight other international development partners, to the development of a voter list with photos. Parliament will recall that profound misgivings over the list prepared for the 2007 elections were a key factor in the postponement of the polls.</p>
<p class="contents">The EC delegation in Dhaka is closely following the voters’ list pilot project and has provided highly positive feedback on the process. The EU has, however, consistently made clear that progress on technical preparations for the elections must be matched by progress on political reforms, and as the EU troika underlined during its visit to Dhaka in June, the political parties must be implicated in the reform process as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="contents">In an encouraging move, the Bangladesh Election Commission has now announced a schedule for consultations with the 15 principal parties in the country.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU has made strong representations to the Government of Bangladesh, and to the military, on the need to ensure respect for the human rights and due process, most recently during a local EU troika démarche to the Foreign Affairs advisors on 8 August. That démarche also provided the opportunity to raise seven individual cases of human rights violations.</p>
<p class="contents">The Government has provided detailed responses to some of those cases. EU heads of mission will continue to pursue human rights concerns with the authorities, with a view to ensuring that those who have committed abuses are appropriately punished and the others released. As to the specific case of United Nations Special Rapporteur, Sigma Huda, the head of the EC delegation in Dhaka has conveyed concerns regarding her medical condition and treatment to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I understand that Mrs Suda is appealing the decision of the trial court, and the EC will follow the case very closely.</p>
<p class="contents">Support for human rights and good governance also constitutes one of the three priorities for the EC financial assistance to Bangladesh under the country strategy paper for 2007-2013, alongside human and social development and trade and economic development. EUR 55 million have been earmarked for action under that priority for the period 2007 to 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, the European Commission remains optimistic that Bangladesh is on track to hold credible parliamentary elections in 2008. We are extending substantial political and financial support to that goal, while – and I would like to underline this – remaining very vigilant on human rights and other concerns. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We might well ask ourselves why the Special Court for Sierra Leone is so important. This is not simply a case of one more of the many African countries with a history of rape and murder. It concerns the prestige and development of the international administration of justice in the area of criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">We have recently witnessed two spectacular failures of this very system, and we should be honest with ourselves and recognise them as such. I refer to the failed attempt to sentence Slobodan Milošević and the exceedingly controversial circumstances surrounding the death of Saddam Hussein. Should a further fiasco now occur in the wake of these much-publicised events, that is to say, should the Court be obliged to cease operations due to a lack of financial resources, it would amount to the <span class="italic">coup de grâce</span> for international administration of justice in the area of criminal law.</p>
<p class="contents">To go into detail, what is at stake is the allocation of less than USD 90 million over the next two and a quarter years, with more than a third of the total to be transferred this year. This is needed in order to ensure the continued operation of the Court. The prestige of the administration of cross-border justice really does depend on the Special Court for Sierra Leone sentencing Charles Taylor, the former President of Liberia, and on it investigating 17 allegations of crimes against humanity and war crimes, including murders and sexual offences.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like publicly to thank two countries from the floor of this House, namely the United Kingdom and the Netherlands, which have provided significant financial support for the Court’s activities. The United Nations also has an important role to play. It cannot behave like Pontius Pilate and simply wash its hands of the matter. I am glad that the European Parliament will speak with one voice on this issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Those same people now view with disbelief the grim prospect that the effort to bring Charles Taylor to book may end up becoming a farce because the Special Court in The Hague ran out of money half way through the trial. Such an eventuality will no doubt be a serious blow to international justice and it will make our citizens lose all faith in the rule of law and order. Furthermore, it will send a very clear encouragement to criminals worldwide to pursue without fear their evil acts of committing genocides and other despicable atrocities against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Irrespective of the outcome of the plea to somehow keep this Special Court on Sierra Leone alive and functioning, one cannot help but raise the following issues.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, the USD 89 million requested by the court to conclude its operations is surely a vast amount of money. How come it is so vast? We all know that lawyers make a bomb, but not a nuclear bomb! Could not such a court operate on a more economically efficient budget? Are there perhaps expensive extravagances and gross inefficiencies resulting in large amounts of financial waste?</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, how much did it cost for a very similar court in The Hague to try, to the extent that it did, Slobodan Milošević? Was the budget then not subject to limitations and why was that so? Is it perhaps different to commit a crime against humanity in Europe than in Africa?</p>
<p class="contents">These questions need answers, which, from my experience in this House, I know I am not going to get, and our citizens may have to resign themselves to believing not that the rule of law holds true but that money rules the law. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Today Sierra Leone has become a synonym for the particular horrors which we have witnessed across Africa over these past few years. We therefore have a responsibility to ensure that the forthcoming elections not only help to restore democracy but also, and far more importantly, restore justice and the rule of law. This must include the prosecution of the massive crimes that have taken place in this country. After all, Europeans were among those who used Mr Taylor as a means by which to enrich themselves from, and in, Sierra Leone.</p>
<p class="contents">That is why I believe that the process of dealing with these crimes cannot be allowed to fail due to a lack of funds. We Europeans have a responsibility in that regard, but I nonetheless believe that the questions that have been raised here are justified. It is apparent that we will not make progress in the long term with <span class="italic">ad hoc</span> tribunals. It is apparent that what we need in the long term is a single universal jurisdiction to deal with these criminal dictators. However, that does not help us at the moment. The first task now is to press ahead with the trials that have already begun and, in particular, to press ahead with securing the conviction of Mr Taylor, for that will send out a warning signal to criminals who are committing crimes against humanity today or who may do so in future: I would mention Zimbabwe's dictator, Mr Mugabe, in this context. Mr Mugabe must be shown what could happen to him if he continues with his horrendous crimes. That is why we need uniform criteria and stable institutions to deal with these massive crimes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As such, I had the opportunity to be able to visit the Special Court <span class="italic">in situ</span> and hear directly from Mrs Mansaray, head of the Registry, about the work the Court is doing. During the visit we were constantly told that if there were no justice there would be no peace. That is precisely why this Court is so important. As stated many times in this resolution, it is crucial for the continued consolidation of the peace process in Sierra Leone to ensure that the crimes do not go unpunished</p>
<p class="contents">It was very expensive and it costs a lot of money because the Court’s work has been of epic proportions; ensuring complete respect for the rule of law in a country that has been devastated by a civil war is very difficult. The first task was to gather all the testimonies and that was no mean feat: the population had to be convinced that there would be no reprisals and that they would not be subjected to any more humiliation.</p>
<p class="contents">The second task was to convince the people that all those involved in human rights violations could be tried, not just the guerrilla leaders. In addition, I must point out that the defence of the accused has been scrupulously respected. The Court also took a historic decision in 2004 to refuse to recognise the applicability of a national amnesty for the perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against humanity.</p>
<p class="contents">Without justice then, there is no peace. It is thus important to contribute to the funding of this Court. We are obliged to contribute towards peace and stability in the Mano River region. The Special Court is itself an example for the reform of Sierra Leone’s judicial system and I would call on the Commission here to look into the possibility of providing financial support for the projects carried out by the United Nations with a view to reforming the country’s judicial system. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Furthermore, it has proved that an international court dealing with war crimes may be located in the country where those crimes were committed, thus allowing local people to have direct access to justice. In addition, if the Special Court for Sierra Leone is compared with similar bodies in other parts of the world, it can be seen that this arrangement has allowed the Court to be fully effective whilst incurring significantly lower costs.</p>
<p class="contents">For the first time in history an incumbent head of state of an African country, Charles Taylor, has been successfully convicted of crimes against humanity. It has also proved possible to establish a legal definition of the notion of child soldiers and forced marriages, so as to enable those guilty of such crimes to be convicted. The Special Court for Sierra Leone may unfortunately have to cease its operations as it is running out of funds. The sum required to allow proceedings against the most notorious criminals to continue is less than USD 90 million. I hereby call on all the Member States and on the Commission to provide funds to support the Special Court for Sierra Leone as soon as possible. Continuation of the peace process and reconciliation in Sierra Leone and the whole of West Africa will be seriously threatened if funding for the Court does not become available. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This simply must happen. The perpetrators of crimes cannot be allowed to believe that they will enjoy impunity, regardless of where they may reside, be it in Europe, in Africa or in any other part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">I should, however, like to take this opportunity to highlight a particular problem, which I believe to be very significant. We are witnessing a proliferation of courts established by the United Nations, a kind of mushrooming of criminal courts. An International Criminal Court was set up in Rome. An International Criminal Tribunal to deal with the crimes that took place in the former Yugoslavia was also set up, and another to deal with the crimes committed in Rwanda. Now we have the Special Court for Sierra Leone. I appreciate that all these courts are necessary, but if they are to be established their funding must be guaranteed from the outset. That is a <span class="italic">sine qua non</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore call on the Commissioner to raise the matter of financing such institutions at the forthcoming EU-Africa summit, due to take place before the end of this year.

<p class="contents">We have fully supported past, current and future actions of the Court in bringing perpetrators of war crimes to justice, thus recognising the suffering of the Sierra Leoneans during the civil war. The work of the Special Court sends an important signal to everyone that serious crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes will no longer remain unpunished, no matter where they have taken place.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has been providing financial assistance to the court since 2002. This assistance was granted indirectly in 2002, by supporting the project worth almost EUR 685 000 through a coalition of NGOs led by No Peace Without Justice to identify human rights violations, to raise awareness among the legal profession and to provide legal assistance to the Government of Sierra Leone. Since 2003, the Commission has provided the funds to the Special Court directly, through the European Initiative for Democracy and Human Rights as already mentioned. An overall budget of about EUR 2.1 million has been allocated to the Court by means of three Victims’ Justice and Legacy projects. The overall objective of these projects was <span class="italic">inter alia</span> to ensure that the Special Court contributes to a broader understanding of justice for victims of the conflict. Moreover, in 2006, the emphasis was given to the coverage and proximity of Charles Taylor’s trial and it targeted civil society groups as well as the people of Liberia and the subregion.</p>
<p class="contents">The Special Court will be supported in 2008 by the new European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights, which was adopted in the context of the new Financial Framework 2007-2013. The amount of EUR 600 000 has been reserved in the annual action plan from the 2007 budget. The Commission is holding the talks with the Court to identify the project proposal for the 2007 funding. It has been said several times by different Members that there are difficulties to find sufficient means for financing the Special Court. That is why the Commission is considering raising this matter with the Member States and it is also exploring the possibility of financing the Court and its outreach activities through other financial instruments. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>Given the Presidency's orientation towards a sustainable, high-quality tourism based on solidarity, will the Presidency say whether it intends to promote cooperation between Member States in order to address such situations and exchange best practices? Does it believe that new measures must be taken aimed at boosting European tourism, while at the same time safeguarding the quality of life of the local population and the good name of tourist destinations?

<p>This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is not binding on the Council or the Member States, was not delivered orally during Question Time to the Council at the 2007 September I part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Presidency confirms that, in its statement entitled ‘A stronger Union for a better world’, the top priority is ‘solidarity between equals’, which in this context means values such as respect for human dignity and citizens’ rights, freedom, democracy, equality and the rule of law.</p>
<p>With regard to tourism, it should be remembered that the EU’s responsibilities in this area, as laid down in the Treaty, are minimal. The current legislation is basically aimed at protecting the consumer (for example, passengers’ rights).</p>
<p>Further to the Council’s Conclusions on tourism of 18 April 2005 and according to the timetable for the 18 months from 1 January 2007 – prepared in conjunction with the previous German Presidency and the subsequent Slovenian Presidency – the Portuguese Presidency will very closely monitor developments in the Commission’s initiatives on the European tourism agenda, all the more so as it regards tourism as a sector with great potential for growth and the sustained creation of employment.</p>
<p>Moreover, in order to highlight the need to integrate tourism within our common agenda, we will host the 6th European Tourism Forum on 26 and 27 October 2007.</p>
<p>The Presidency hopes that the aspects mentioned in the honourable Member’s question may also be tackled during future discussions and is counting on appropriate measures being taken by the competent bodies to prevent the harmful effects on tourism described in the honourable Member’s question.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0583"></a>

<p>Repeated calls have been made on the EU to regulate the activity of players' agents. This is often linked to reports of bad practices in the activities of some agents which have allegedly resulted in instances of corruption, money laundering and exploitation of under age players. However, it is a complex issue, since agents are subject to differing regulations in different Member States. Some Member States have introduced specific legislation on players' agents while in others the applicable law is the general law regarding employment agencies, but with references to players' agents. Moreover, some international federations have introduced their own regulations.</p>

<p>For the realisation of the abovementioned impact assessment, which conditions any potential EU measure in this field, the Commission considers that an external study is necessary.

<p>In its White Paper on Sport the Commission reaffirms its support for school sport and university sport. The background and context document accompanying the White Paper on Sport specifically mentions the summer and winter Universiades organised by the International University Sports Federation (FISU). The European Union has given support, including financial support, to events such as the European Youth Olympic Festival in Jaca in 2007.</p>
<p>Pan-European school and university sports championships could undoubtedly help to enhance the role of sport in health and education in Europe. However, the Commission is respectful of the autonomy of sports organisations and considers that the decisions about such competitions or competitions on the United States of America model of college championships belong to the relevant sports and education institutions.</p>
<p>The White Paper on Sport recalls that sport and physical activity can be supported through the Lifelong Learning programme. Promoting participation in educational opportunities through sport is thus a priority topic for school partnerships supported by the Comenius programme and for thematic networks and mobility in the field of higher education supported by the Erasmus programme.</p>
<p>Furthermore, as part of its Action Plan "Pierre de Coubertin" accompanying the White Paper on Sport, the Commission will introduce the award of a European label to schools actively involved in supporting and promoting physical activities in a school environment.</p>
<p>Finally, the Commission draws the Honourable Member's attention to the new event created by the International Olympic Committee, namely the organisation of the 1st Summer Youth Olympic Games in 2010.

Does the Commission believe that the harmonisation of the public sector retirement age for men and women should be achieved by increasing the retirement age of women to 65 years or rather by reducing the retirement age for men to 60?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Honourable Member puts several questions regarding proceedings against Greece before the European Court of Justice. The infringement procedure in question concerns the Greek Code for Military and Civil Pensions, especially the rules defining retirement age which are more favourable for women than for men. The rules vary depending on the circumstances but are in any event more favourable for women. For instance, widows, divorced or single women with unmarried children are allowed to go on pension after 15 or 17 years of service. The same rule does not apply to men.</p>
<p>As regards the question as to whether the Greek Military and Civil Pension scheme forms part of statutory social security, it should be noted that in a series of judgments, the European Court of Justice confirmed that, as a general rule, a pension paid by an employer to a former employee by reason of the employment relationship between them constitutes pay within the meaning of Article 141 of the EC Treaty. It does therefore not form part of statutory social security pensions. More in particular, the Court has also noted that pensions paid by the State to former civil servants who have worked in the public sector constitute pay within the meaning of Article 141 of the EC Treaty (C-7/93 Beune; C-366/99 Griesmar; C-351/00 Niemi; C-4/02, Schönheit). It has held in Case Griesmar that civil servants must be regarded as constituting a "particular category of workers". As a consequence, the Court has considered that the French pension scheme for civil servants therefore does not form part of statutory social security schemes but have to be considered as “pay” within the meaning of Article 141 of the EC Treaty. This approach has been confirmed also in regard to the German and the Finnish civil servants' pension schemes.</p>
<p>Pension schemes falling within the scope of Article 141 of the EC Treaty must respect the principle of equal treatment. This means that different conditions governing access to 'pay' (including pension) for men and women performing the same or comparable work infringe the principle of equal pay. Therefore, different retirement ages are to be considered as discrimination on grounds of sex. Provisions on different retirement ages are thus contrary to Article 141 of the EC Treaty.</p>
<p>The Commission takes the view that the Greek Code for Military and Civil Pensions provides for pensions which have to be considered as pay in the sense of Article 141 of the EC Treaty. They are paid to a “particular category of workers” by reason of the employment relationship.</p>
<p>Therefore these pensions do not form part of social security schemes.</p>
<p>As regards the second question on whether the differences in retirement age could be considered as “positive action” in favour of women, the Commission considers that different retirement ages cannot be considered as positive action. “Positive Action” within the meaning of Article 141 (4) of the EC Treaty are measures "providing for specific advantages in order to make it easier for the under-represented sex to pursue a vocational activity or to prevent or compensate for disadvantages in professional careers."</p>
<p>With regard to this particular aspect, in Case C-366/99 Griesmar (at point 65) the Court held that "(…) the measure … does not appear to be of a nature such as to offset the disadvantages to which the careers of female civil servants are exposed by helping those women in their professional life. On the contrary, that measure is limited to granting female civil servants who are mothers a service credit at the date of their retirement, without providing a remedy for the problems which they may encounter in the course of their professional career."</p>
<p>The same argument applies here: granting women in special circumstances an earlier retirement does not help them to pursue their professional careers but only helps them to receive more favourable conditions for an early retirement. Therefore, it cannot be considered as a measure in the context of “positive action”.</p>
<p>Finally, in response to the last question on how should the harmonisation of retirement age be achieved, in the Smith-judgment (C-408/92, point 22) the Court held that Community law precludes national equalizing measures which raise "the retirement age for women to that for men in relation to periods of service completed between 17 May 1990, the date of that judgment (i.e. case Barber, C-262/88) and the date on which those measures come into force. On the other hand, as regards periods of service completed after the latter date, Article 119 (now Article 141 of the EC Treaty) does not prevent an employer from taking that step. As regards periods of service prior to 17 May 1990, Community law imposed no obligation which would justify retroactive reduction of the advantages which women enjoyed."</p>
<p>Therefore, Community law does not allow for retrospectively raising the retirement age for women in relation to periods of service completed between 17 May 1990 and the date of entry into force of the measures by which equality is achieved in the scheme in question. However, as regards periods in the future, the Member State is free to decide how to achieve equalisation of retirement age or of other eligibility conditions to take up pensions, the objective being to achieve equal gender treatment in all respects.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0588"></a>

<p>(FR) The relevant Community provisions on fire fighting are set out in Framework Directive 89/391/EEC<a href="#defann_9_1" name="refann_9_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and more specifically in Directive 89/654/EEC<a href="#defann_9_2" name="refann_9_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> concerning the minimum safety and health requirements for the workplace.</p>
<p>These Directives do not lay down any requirement for fire sprinklers to be installed in all workplaces. Nevertheless, given that they are based on a preventive approach the Directives seek to protect the health and safety of workers from fire by requiring workplaces to be equipped with ‘appropriate fire-fighting equipment’ in accordance with the specific characteristics of each workplace. In addition, employers must ‘be in possession of an assessment of the risks’ covered by the Framework Directive and ‘take the necessary measures’ for fire fighting.</p>
<p>The Commission emphasises that fire sprinklers are not the most appropriate means of fighting fires in every case. In fact, their use is not recommended for fighting certain types of fire, for example electrical fires, fires involving gas or flammable liquids and certain fires of chemical origin. As a consequence, the Commission does not intend to conduct research into the installation of fire sprinklers in all places of work.</p>
<p>Moreover, rules on the installation of fire sprinklers are also laid down in the provisions of Directive 95/16/EC<a href="#defann_9_3" name="refann_9_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> concerning health and safety problems when lifts are installed. In this respect, Article 2(3) of the Directive stipulates that ‘Member States shall take all necessary measures to ensure that shafts intended for lifts do not contain any piping or wiring or fittings other than that necessary for the operation and safety of the lift’.</p>
<p>In addition, the automatic triggering of a sprinkler system that is not correctly installed could compromise the safe use of lifts equipped with such a system and pose an additional risk to people trapped in a lift as a result of a fire if wiring or other electrical components are installed in the lift shaft.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The purpose of the Commission’s proposal for a Directive providing for sanctions against employers of illegally staying third country nationals<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> is indeed to fight against illegal immigration, by reducing the employment pull factor.</p>
<p>Illegally staying third country nationals can be subject to exploitation, sometimes serious, at the workplace. The proposal does not affect third country nationals’ fundamental rights as workers. The Commission has stated that Member States should also apply effective sanctions for breaches of legislation in particular on health and safety at the workplace which often occur in the context of this type of illegal employment<a href="#defann_10_2" name="refann_10_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.

The results of this call for proposals will be known in September. The Commission expects to co-fund a number of multilateral projects and networks in this field.</p>

Fragmentation of production and marketing in the soft fruit sector was identified by the Commission as one of the structural deficiencies in its report from mid 2006. Now the producing countries have an instrument to redress the situation within a five year period.</p>
<p>As far as apples are concerned, the EU was already a major apple producer before recent enlargements. This is why no new support scheme is foreseen, even on a transitional basis.</p>
<p>The Commission would like to recall that a major objective of the fruit and vegetable reform was a more market oriented sector. This is why it was decided to remove the existing aids to products intended for processing and to not create new ones.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0537"></a>

The rights and obligations resulting for the new Member States from those agreements shall not be affected during the period in which the provisions of those agreements are provisionally maintained.</p>
<p>Article 6(9) further states that as soon as possible, and in any event before the expiry of those fishery agreements, appropriate decisions for the continuation of fisheries activities resulting from those agreements shall be adopted in each case by the Council acting by qualified majority on a proposal from the Commission, including the possibility of extending certain agreements for periods not exceeding one year.</p>
<p>The Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Estonian Republic on cooperation in the field of conservation of fish stocks in the Chudskoye, Teploye and Pskov Lakes entered into force on 3 June 1994 (hereafter referred to as the "Agreement"). According to Article 8 of this Agreement, it shall remain in force for five years and shall automatically be extended for further five-year periods unless one party communicates in writing, at least three months prior to the end of the corresponding period, its desire to terminate the Agreement. In light of this Article and the information currently available to the Commission, the Agreement appears to remain in force until 2009.</p>
<p>According to Article 2(1) of the bilateral Agreement, the Parties shall establish an intergovernmental committee on fisheries in the Chudskoye, Teploye and Pskov Lakes. In accordance with Article 2(2), meetings of the Committee shall take place at least twice a year. Pursuant to Article 3, the tasks of the Committee shall include drawing up recommendations with regard to establishing a total allowable catch for each species of fish and allocating it between the Parties, as well as regulating fishing equipment and methods, minimum permitted sizes for fish caught and the percentage of young fish to be taken.</p>
<p>Article 3(1)(e) of the EC Treaty in conjunction with Article 32 and Annex I defines the scope of the Common Fisheries Policy. By virtue of these Articles, the Common Fisheries Policy covers the so-called "Chapter 3 products", i.e. fresh, frozen, smoked, filleted etc. fish, and "Chapter 16 products", i.e. processed fishery products, irrespective of whether they stem from marine capture fisheries, from freshwater fisheries, from inland fisheries or from fish farming. Therefore, although the above-mentioned "Agreement" between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the Estonian Republic concerns inland fisheries, it does not alter the fact that, as from the date of accession, fisheries agreements concluded by the new Member States with third countries shall be managed by the Community.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding this, the Commission has not so far been involved in the meetings of the intergovernmental committee set up in accordance with the above mentioned "Agreement".</p>
<p>Between 10 – 12 July 2006, the European Community and the Russian Federation negotiated and concluded an Agreement on co-operation in fisheries and the conservation of the living marine resources in the Baltic Sea. The entry into force of this Agreement is currently pending the adoption by the Council of the Regulation on the conclusion of the Agreement and the subsequent signature of the Agreement by the Parties. This Agreement does not cover inland fisheries. However, the Commission will consider taking advantage of the contacts foreseen within the new bilateral Agreement for the Baltic Sea to raise the matter concerning the above-mentioned "Agreement" with its Russian fishery counterparts in order to explore the possible modalities of re-launching the consultations foreseen in this "Agreement" and progressively addressing the most important problems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0544"></a>

<p>The prefabricated blocks of flats built in the V4 countries and in Bulgaria and Romania are now over 40 years old and they are in urgent need of refurbishment. The buildings are in such a poor state of repair primarily on account of system failures, defective statics, inadequate thermal insulation and high energy consumption. However, the granting of financial support from the Structural Funds for comprehensive refurbishment of the buildings is barred under the Commission's de minimis rule, pursuant to which State support to one and the same recipient may not exceed EUR 200 000 in any three-year period. In the case of prefabricated blocks of flats which are managed by just a handful of individuals (the housing collective), that is a very small amount. The average cost of refurbishment is EUR 17 058 per flat. Together with the Commission, ministers from the above-mentioned countries have appointed a group of experts to assess whether or not the terms and conditions governing the use of EU aid for the refurbishment of prefabricated blocks of flats are incorporated into current legislation.</p>
<p>What view does the Commission take of this problem? Is it planning to change the rule which stands in the way of urban renewal and which has the effect of lowering EU citizens' quality of life?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The granting of financial support from the Structural Funds for comprehensive refurbishment of buildings is not limited to the Commission's de minimis regulation<a href="#defann_17_1" name="refann_17_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which allows the granting by Member States of a maximum of € 200,000 per beneficiary over any three year period.</p>
<p>In fact, the assistance for urban renewal under Community programmes, such as JESSICA (Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas), may exceed that amount. These programmes, which support the financing and implementation of urban development and renewal and social housing, play an important role in the new Cohesion policy for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>The de minimis rule is a regulation that sets a threshold figure below which support granted by a Member State does not have a substantial effect on competition and trade between Member States and therefore does not constitute State Aid in the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty. In this context, it is important to recall that when financing from the Structural Funds constitutes State Aid in the meaning of Article 87(1) of the EC Treaty, it could then still be exempted from the notification obligation if it fulfils the criteria set out in the block exemption regulations (Small and Medium Enterprises, training, employment and regional aid).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, on account of its characteristics, State Aid to social housing is exempted from prior notification to the Commission, whatever the amount of support, provided certain conditions are met. The Commission's Decision of 28 November 2005<a href="#defann_17_2" name="refann_17_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> block exempted from the notification obligation State Aid to social housing, to the extent that it is a Service of General Economic Interest and fulfils the conditions set out in the Decision. This exemption would apply ceteris paribus to measures in favour of urban renewal in the context of social housing.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is important to stress that social housing measures which do not fulfil the above-mentioned conditions should be notified to the Commission and may still be declared compatible. Indeed, the Commission may and has authorised numerous State Aid measures concerning regeneration, including housing regeneration in areas experiencing or threatened by physical deterioration and social exclusion under the above Treaty provisions<a href="#defann_17_3" name="refann_17_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The Commission will continue to take a positive view concerning housing regeneration measures comparable to those already approved, i.e. those measures addressing the needs of the most vulnerable citizens that cause relatively low distortion of competition and effect on intra-EU trade.</p>

<p>The positive vote from the Parliament in July 2007 on the programme of Community Action in Health offers a solid legal basis for actions that we need to take at European level.</p>
<p>To achieve the Community goal of a more cohesive Europe, we need to reduce the major inequalities across the EU in terms of life expectancy, health status, and access to high-quality health services.</p>
<p>There are major differences across the EU not only in quality of life, but also in productivity and labour participation.</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member rightly notes, the Programme focuses on addressing health inequalities, and provides for action to improve solidarity between health systems.</p>
<p>However, parallel to this, the Programme also aims to contribute to providing citizens with better access to information as a means to increasing their ability to exercise their rights and make decisions which cater for their best interests.</p>
<p>Such initiatives will need to take full account of consultation with a broad range of stakeholders, and in particular, will be shaped in partnership with organisations which represent patients’ interests.</p>
<p>The Programme provides the legal basis for offering financial support to non-governmental organisations or specialised networks, which take forward the agenda of the Programme.</p>
<p>The priorities and allocation of financial resources for the implementation of the Programme will be set each year on the basis of the annual work plan.</p>
<p>The issue of patient rights raised by the Honourable Member is important. The Commission would like to recall the discussions that it had with the Parliament on issues related to patient rights in the EU in March and in June this year.

<p>The Commission considers that European tourism industry has a strong growth and jobs potential. As outlined by the Commission in March 2006 in its Communication on a “A renewed EU Tourism Policy: Towards a stronger partnership for European Tourism”, the Commission aims to improve the competitiveness of the European tourism industry and create more and better jobs through the sustainable growth of tourism in Europe and globally, while acknowledging that the competence for tourism is essentially with Member States.</p>
<p>The most appropriate instruments for the attainment of this aim have been identified in the abovementioned Communication and imply co-ordination within the Commission and national authorities, co-operation between the different stakeholders, and the establishment of specific supporting actions in the following areas:</p>
<p>Mainstreaming measures affecting tourism</p>
<p>Policy-coordination</p>
<p>Most Community actions aiming to support the competitiveness of European tourism are carried out through the Enterprise policy instruments, nevertheless many other European policies impact tourism directly or indirectly. In order to reach policy-coordination:</p>
<p>each year, the initiatives that may affect tourism, included in the Commission Work Programme, are identified in order to make sure that their impact on the sector’s competitiveness will be taken into account at an early stage;</p>
<p>the members of the Advisory Committee on Tourism are kept informed on the tourism-related initiatives included in its Work Programme so that public administrations can also keep the various stakeholders, at national, regional and local level, regularly informed of the Commission initiatives;</p>
<p>the Commission consults with and informs the tourism stakeholders on issues and initiatives affecting tourism.</p>
<p>Improved use of available European financial instruments</p>
<p>Tourism has benefited greatly from the financial support offered by the various European financial instruments. In the period 2007-2013, the Structural Funds and other EU Programmes, will financially support and give Member States the possibility to support the development of tourism businesses, services and infrastructure (European Regional Development Fund, Cohesion Fund, European Social Fund, Integrated Lifelong Learning Programme, European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development, European Fisheries Fund, Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme, 7th EC Framework Programme for Research, Technological Development and Demonstration activities, to name the most important ones).</p>
<p>Promoting tourism sustainability</p>
<p>A European Agenda 21 for tourism</p>
<p>The Commission launched the preparation of a European Agenda 21 for tourism and set up in 2004 the Tourism Sustainability Group (TSG) in order to encourage stakeholder synergies and to provide input into the Agenda 21 process for the sustainability of European tourism.</p>
<p>The TSG has finalised its work in a report published in February 2007, the Commission has organised a public consultation exercise in April-June and building on the report will present in 2007 a communication for a European Agenda 21 for tourism.</p>
<p>Enhancing the understanding and the visibility of tourism</p>
<p>Improving the understanding and visibility of tourism: a common goal</p>
<p>Each year, since 2002, an Annual European Tourism Forum is hosted by a different Member State. It is organised in close collaboration with the Commission, the Member States and the European tourism industry. This year the European Tourism Forum will be held in Algarve on 25<span class="sup">th</span> – 26<span class="sup">th</span> October.</p>
<p>Also a number of Council Presidencies have been organising Tourism Ministerial meetings, specific Conferences and events or co-organising the European Tourism Forum with the host countries. The Commission will continue to actively support such initiatives and to encourage future Presidencies to do likewise.</p>
<p>Supporting the promotion of European destinations</p>
<p>To contribute to the marketing of Europe as a set of attractive tourist destinations the Commission financed the creation of the European Tourist Destinations Portal and entrusted the European Travel Commission with its management. It is also managing a “European destinations of excellence award” in close collaboration with Member States.</p>
<p>Finally, it analysed the impact of sport and cultural events on tourism oriented small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in order to address recommendations to future event hosts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0554"></a>

<p>The Commission has been supporting since 1998 the efforts of successive Bolivian Governments in reducing coca's cultivation and its illegal transformation into cocaine. Community aid has thus funded "alternative / comprehensive development" programmes in Bolivia aiming mainly at:</p>
<p>promoting sustainable socio-economic development;</p>
<p>easing availability as well as access to basic services for the population of both coca cultivation and labour out-migration regions;</p>
<p>strenghtening local institutions (municipalities).</p>
<p>These activities go beyond the substitution of coca's cultivation with other crops (pineapple, palm-hearts, green pepper, passion fruit, bananas, etc.) and try to favour a locally driven development process.</p>
<p>Continued EU presence in this crucial area of cooperation is foreseen under the 2007-2013 Bolivia's Country Strategy Paper (CSP), presented to the Parliament's Committee on Development in March 2007 and adopted by the Commission in July 2007.</p>
<p>One of the three priority sectors of the CSP is: "Supporting Bolivia's fight against illicit drug production and trafficking – comprehensive development and rationalisation of coca production through social control mechanisms".</p>
<p>The 2007 Bolivia's Annual Action Programme is focusing on this specific sector with two actions:</p>
<p>Support to the National Comprehensive Development Plan (€ 26 million)</p>
<p>Support to the Social Control of Coca Production (€ 10 million)</p>

<p>The management of music rights both online and offline is at a crossroads. Firstly, the Commission is preparing to give a decision in the CISAC case (COMP/C2/38.698).

<p>Culture and cultural diversity are a principal objective that underpins all Commission initiatives adopted in the field of copyright and collective management of copyright and related rights. The Commission's initiatives in the field of collective management are therefore inspired by the goal of fostering cultural diversity, especially the protection of niche repertoires and their EU-wide online availability and exploitation. This culture-friendly approach requires serious reflection on how online licensing is best organised across the EU. Licensing models that are good for culture and repertoire should not be abandoned merely because they imply certain changes to traditional forms of rights management.</p>
<p>The Commission now intends to assess the development of the EU's online licensing practices in the music sector in the light of the Commission Recommendation of 18 October 2005. On 17 January 2007 the Commission invited the Parliament and all interested stakeholders to submit views and comments on their initial experience with the Recommendation and, in particular, on their views how the EU licensing of niche repertoire could be further encouraged. All stakeholders were invited to comment on the above-mentioned issues until 1 July 2007. As responses were still received by the end of July, the process of reviewing the submissions is still ongoing. After thorough examination the Commission will assess further policy steps with respect to how collecting societies operate online but also in the traditional offline environment. While it is too early to envisage future policy, any follow-up, if necessary, will be closely co-ordinated with the Parliament and the Council.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0563"></a>

<p>The Commission is continuously developing with the Council, the Parliament and the Member States a common integrated border management policy. The FRONTEX Agency is a key component of that policy.</p>
<p>Since its setting up, numerous border control operations have been successfully coordinated by FRONTEX. The joint operations have proven their added value at European level and will be further complemented by the establishment of Rapid Border Intervention Teams (RABIT). The Council and the Parliament adopted this new regulation on 11 July 2007<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>As regard the technical equipment at FRONTEX disposal, the Commission should recall that in accordance with Article 7 of Council Regulation (EC) no 2007/2004 establishing the FRONTEX Agency, "the Agency shall set up and keep centralised records of technical equipment for control and surveillance of external borders belonging to Member States, which they, on a voluntary basis and upon request of another Member State, are willing to put at the disposal of that Member State for a temporary period following a needs and risks analysis carried out by the Agency".</p>
<p>It should be highlighted that the technical equipment, which can be used for control and surveillance of the external borders, is made available by Member States on a voluntary basis and upon request from another Member State. Furthermore the technical equipment remains the property of the contributing Member State. The list of technical equipment is an evolving list, which needs to be adapted on a regular basis to take into account new or changing situations related to the control and surveillance of external borders of the Member States.</p>
<p>As the information on equipment provided by Member States to the FRONTEX Agency is not in the public domain, the Commission is not in a position to provide an overview of the contributions by Member States.</p>
<p>In this context the Commission would like to refer to the reply it provided on written question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2007-1676_EN.html">E-1676/07</a> by Mr Vanhecke on the same subject.</p>
<p>Readmission and return are important elements of the European efforts to tackle illegal immigration. Specific initiatives are taken to identify the country of origin of those who arrive at the borders of EU Member States, also in view of their possible repatriation. The EC has concluded readmission agreements with several countries like Sri Lanka, the Russian Federation and Albania. EC readmission agreements with Ukraine, Bosia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, FYROM, Serbia and Moldova are in the process of ratficiation and negotiations with Morocco should be finalized soon. Article 13 of the Partnership Agreement between the African, Caribbean and Pacific States and the EU and its Member States also includes clear readmission obligations.</p>
<p>In this context the Commission would like to underline the importance she attaches to ensuring that return operations take place in full compliance with fundamental rights, the international humanitarian obligations and the rule of law.</p>
<p>Moreover, in its Communication on circular migration and mobility partnership adopted on 16 May 2007, the Commission announced that the EU is ready to negotiate mobility partnerships with third countries that have committed themselves to cooperating actively on management of migration flows, and would be ready to work closely with the EU and its Member States in the fight against illegal migration, including readmission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>At the initiative of the Commission a proposed new framework directive on type-approval has been submitted to the Institutions on 14 July 2003. This Directive is a recast of Council Directive 70/156/EEC of 6 February 1970 on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to the type-approval of motor vehicles and their trailers<a href="#defann_25_3" name="refann_25_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. Its main objective is to extend the Community whole vehicle type-approval to categories of vehicles which were partially excluded until now, i.e. commercial vehicles (vans, trucks, buses and minibuses, coaches, trailers and semi-trailers ).</p>
<p>On 23 July 2007, the Council has accepted the amendments adopted by the Parliament in second reading. Therefore, the publication of the framework Directive is expected to take place in October 2007.</p>
<p>One of the major consequences of the implementation of the Community whole vehicle type-approval to commercial vehicles is that more than 40 separate directives dealing with safety will become mandatory in the European Union. Concretely, that means that vehicles will have to be fitted with type-approved safety devices such as antilock brakes, new rear-view mirrors, front-, rear underrun- and side-protections, day-time running lamps etc. The mandatory fitting of electronic stability control is under consideration.</p>
<p>Community type-approval for commercial vehicles will be enforced on a voluntary basis in a first step from January 2009 and a bit later on a compulsory basis in relation to a timetable which has been settled by the Institutions.</p>
<p>The Commission is convinced that these important measures will significantly contribute to improve road safety.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Commission attaches great importance to the protection and promotion of human rights and consistently calls on both parties – Israel and the Palestinian Authority – to comply with their commitments under international law. The Commission is of the view that there is sufficient human rights monitoring capacity in Israel and the Occupied Palestinian Territory.</p>
<p>The EU Presidency, the Commission, and Member States on the ground monitor the situation very closely and have regular exchanges on the human rights situation both in Jerusalem and in Tel Aviv. Abundant information is also available through various other reliable sources, such as the non-governmental organisations monitoring human rights.</p>
<p>The situation of human rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory is also regularly on agenda of the United Nations (UN) Human Rights Council and is monitored by Mr John Dugard, the UN Special Rapporteur on the situation of Human Rights in the Occupied Palestinian Territory.</p>
<p>Respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms, and international law constitutes an essential element of our Association Agreement with Israel. In the framework of the European Neighborhood Policy (ENP) Action Plan with Israel, special attention is given to the respect, promotion and upholding of these values. Human rights issues, including those related to access and movement, are regularly raised with the relevant Israeli authorities in the framework of the political dialogue subcommittee as well as in the Informal Group on Human Rights.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission is committed to continue close cooperation with civil society in promoting human rights. This includes providing funding to local organizations through the European Instrument for Democracy and Human Rights (EIDHR). Human rights issues are mainstreamed to all EU assistance, including the civil society programmes.</p>
<p>With regard to hindered access of the Palestinians to work, health and education facilities, the European Union has consistently called for the full implementation of the Agreement on Movement and Access of 2005.

<p>Growing dairy product demand from countries such as India and China is causing the price of milk to rise. Milk, containing very many vitamins and nutrients, is of vital importance to countries threatened with famine. Most people in Africa already only drink powdered milk, since there are no means of producing real milk locally. For those countries reliant solely on imports, the increase in the price of milk on the world market is life-threatening. Other poor countries which do produce milk and can see that demand is rising do not have the resources to increase their production and compete with the large European firms.</p>
<p>A very considerable rise in milk and dairy product prices over the next few years is forecast. In a development cooperation context, too, how will the Commission respond to this change? Will the EU revise its agricultural policy, e.g. as regards European milk surpluses, in the light of these developments?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The current developments on the world dairy market are simply the result of supply and demand. This market situation may continue for some time, but it seems likely that in the medium term, prices will come down from their current very high levels.</p>
<p>With all aid schemes for the EU dairy sector at zero, the milk quota system is the only "active" dairy market management instrument.</p>
<p>Changes to the quota system should be well prepared and not based on conjunctural movements on the international market. Although it is true that the milk quota system is not very flexible for the short term, it is also a reality that milk production cannot be increased from one day to another, even in the absence of a quota system. Increases in EU quota of almost 500.000 tonnes are programmed for this year and next year.</p>
<p>The upcoming discussions in the context of the Health Check are meant to see if the policy reform of 2003 achieves its objectives: a competitive, market oriented and sustainable agriculture. This includes the dairy policy.</p>
<p>It must be born in mind that milk production will only expand if it is profitable. Since producers are confronted by increased prices for their raw materials, their profit margins can only be maintained (or increased) if they are rewarded with higher prices for their milk.</p>
<p>In its Development Policy, the Commission encourages and supports all initiatives which can help our partners in reaching the Millenium Development Goals. The livestock sector, including dairy, is a major contributor to poverty reduction and to equitable, safe and sustainable economic growth promotion.</p>
<p>The conjunctural market situation will not change dramatically the development process engaged in by developing countries to develop their national dairy markets, but high prices may actually facilitate this process and underline the relevance of investments made. In addition, through Development Cooperation, the Commission tries to assist farmers in developing countries to comply with the demanding rules for regional and international market access.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to monitor very closely developments in the dairy markets.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0574"></a>

<p>The Commission supports the projects of the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) Roadmap through the preparatory phase grants of the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme (FP7). The preparatory phase will allow each project, in particular, to develop a financial engineering plan needed for the actual construction phase.</p>
<p>Around €147 million will be used in 2007 and 2008 for the preparatory phases which should have a catalytic effect on national funding, the main source of funding for the construction. The next call for proposal for Community support concerning the preparatory phase is planned for 2010 with an indicative budget of €70 million. It should be noted that from 2009 onward, €130 million, of which €60 million for the e-infrastructures projects, should be made available to support directly the construction of a few projects in complement to national funding.</p>
<p>As regards financial support through Cohesion Policy Funds, national or regional authorities are expected to support a limited number of projects of the ESFRI Roadmap. In the majority of cases, financing through Cohesion Policy Funds would be based on the contribution of the projects to the objectives of the programmes and used mainly for satellite regional installations that should allow for the preparation of national teams before they can access directly large installations.</p>
<p>The European Investment Bank (EIB) is a possible source of financing with the instruments specific to a bank (loans, guarantees, etc.). Within this framework the Commission is planning to organise before the end of 2007 (the date of 16 November 2007 is envisaged) an information day, including bilateral meetings, for the coordinators of the ESFRI's list. The representatives of the EIB will present the financial instruments proposed by the EIB to support such projects and will be available to discuss with the coordinators the specific needs for their projects.</p>
<p>In addition, the Risk Sharing Finance Facility (RSFF), a new scheme developed by the Commission and the EIB and managed by the EIB, may be used, to support the projects of the ESFRI Roadmap. Already, in 2007, €40 million have been provided by the FP7 Research Infrastructure Programme to the RSFF. The FP7 legal basis foresees a total contribution for this action for the period 2007 – 2013 amounting to €200 million.</p>
<p>As an output of the Communication recently adopted on the synergies between FP7, the Competitiveness and Innovation Framework Programme (CIP), and the Cohesion Funds ("Competitive European regions through research and innovation: A contribution to more growth and more and better jobs"), the Commission will prepare by the end of 2007 a practical guide looking at the funding opportunities through the eyes of a research institution or a company wishing to use EU funding to undertake research and innovation activities.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the work programme 2008 of the Regions of Knowledge Programme of FP7 (Capacities Specific Programme) will identify "Maximising the benefits of research infrastructures<a href="#defann_28_1" name="refann_28_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> for regional development" as one of the two themes of the call for proposals in its dimension "Analysis and formulation of research agendas and definition of a Joint Action Plan" (budget foreseen: €9.3 million; funding scheme: coordination and support actions of an average amount of €1 million).</p>
<p>Notwithstanding all these potential sources of funding it is clear that the smooth implementation of the projects of the ESFRI Roadmap will also require a very substantial increase in the infrastructure budget of the Member States.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The railways privatisation policy, involving the payment of subsidies worth billions of euros to undertakings in this sector, has adversely affected labour relations and workers' rights in the railway sector. It has also led to staff shortages in most Member States, notably in all branches of the Hellenic Railways Organisation, in the UK and elsewhere; this in turn has led to poor standards of maintenance and repairs of rolling stock, which poses a danger for the safety of workers and passengers. It is particularly alarming that the number of accidents has increased recently, especially since services were handed over to the private sector and with the leasing of train services by companies. The crash between a passenger and freight train in Athens on 12.07.2007 in which 53 people were injured and the 15 train derailments in Greece recently illustrate the scale of the problem.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not agree that rail transport is a social benefit which cannot be provided satisfactorily by private companies?

<p>The Commission considers that railway transport has a number of positive socio-economic effects, notably by providing mobility to all social groups in an environmentally sustainable manner. Rail is also a very safe mode of transport. However, in many countries the national railway undertakings have not been able to adapt the service offer to the changing needs of modern societies and economies.</p>
<p>This has led to a decline of railway transport in Europe since the 1970ies. In order to revitalise the railway sector the Commission has initiated in the 1990ies a new policy aiming at integrating the market at EU level and at overcoming the technical and regulatory fragmentation of national rail transport systems. The implementation of this policy calls for a restructuring of the national railway undertakings to enable them to organise production more efficiently and to provide modern transport services geared to the needs of their customers and users. It does not however require necessarily the privatisation of these undertakings.</p>
<p>This new policy starts to bear fruit as the Commission concluded in its report on the implementation of the first railway package of May 2006<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.

<p>Popular tourist destinations in the EU are visited every year by thousands of tourists, imposes a heavy burden on the natural environment and the quality of life of the local population.

<p>The Tourism Sustainability Group , which was set up in 2005 and is chaired by the Commission in order to provide input for the Agenda 21 for European tourism, has debated the effect of tourism on the economy, the environment and the quality of life of inhabitants in tourist destinations, but there has been no particular focus on management of “popular” destinations.</p>
<p>However, the Commission has published studies that are linked to this issue, such as the “Early warning system for identifying declining tourism destinations and preventive best practices” (2004) where the signals of decline pertain to the economic, social and environmental dimensions and where the focus is on destinations with a certain tradition in providing tourism.</p>
<p>The Tourism Sustainability Group has considered the possibility to propose a charter of rights and obligations of European tourists. It came to the conclusion that more knowledge on the effectiveness and exchange of practical experience of these approaches in different parts of Europe is needed. The Group also discussed a European code of conduct for tourist undertakings, but decided to first consider thoroughly the existing certification schemes (i.e. eco-labels).</p>
<p>The first experiences with the initiative "European Destinations of Excellence" are very encouraging. 9 Member States (Austria, Belgium (Wallonie), Cyprus, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Malta) and 1 candidate country (Croatia) had participated in the first year of the pilot project. The number of participating countries in the second year has almost doubled (16 Member States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Romania, Spain - and 2 candidate countries: Croatia and Turkey). Three more countries have shown an interest in being associated to the project.</p>
<p>This high participation is a clear demonstration of the interest in the pilot project. The involvement in the first year of the project has been used by participants to raise awareness of the importance of rural resources, local heritage and sustainability in tourism, to cope with seasonality, to award destinations which have implemented initiatives and strategies helping to stimulate tourism demand, to encourage other destinations to launch new initiatives and implement successful pilot projects and to help model initiatives to gain international recognition.</p>
<p>Thanks to the project, hidden and not quite well known European destinations will be brought to the forefront. The opportunity of networking with European destinations selected in other countries, domestic networking among applicants, the promotion of best-practice and the exchange of experience in the field of sustainable destination management have also been considered as an important opportunity provided by taking part in the pilot project.</p>
<p>The Commission launched the pilot project which has been requested by the Parliament with the intention of highlighting the variety and quality of tourism destinations in Europe and to further promote this important sector of European economy.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0582"></a>

<p>There is no specific budget line for allocation of funds to the Baltic Sea Strategy. However, it is important to promote a regional approach to existing problems in a more coordinated way, for example by getting the countries in the region to think about programming their structural funds interventions, in order to take account of the common needs of the regions involved. It is important that the Member States in the region should be committed to such an approach.</p>
<p>Under the European Territorial Cooperation objective, the transnational cooperation programme "Baltic Sea Region" (BSR) covers the whole region. It could therefore provide a useful instrument for further coordination, should the partners so wish. Participating Member States are Sweden, Finland, Denmark, Germany (northern parts), Poland, Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia. The total allocation from the European Regional Development Fund for the programme is € 208 million for the period 2007-2013.</p>
<p>The neighbouring countries of Norway, Russia (north-western regions) and Belarus also participate in the activities of the BSR programme. Norway will make available their own additional funding and some € 23 million will be provided by the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument (ENPI) to allow participation of the eligible regions in Russia and Belarus.</p>
<p>The overall strategy of the BSR programme is to strengthen the development towards a sustainable, competitive and territorially integrated region by connecting potential interests and partners across the borders. The focus is on preparation of investments aimed at improving the territorial potential of the region, minimising the considerable differences in the level of socio-economic development between the western and eastern parts and at resolving several issues of common concern for all the countries around the Baltic Sea.</p>
<p>The priorities of the BSR programme are as follows:</p>
<p>Fostering of innovations across the BSR,</p>
<p>External and internal accessibility of the BSR,</p>
<p>Management of the Baltic Sea as a common Resource,</p>
<p>Promoting attractive and competitive cities and regions.</p>
<p>Moreover, numerous other programmes cover different parts of the BSR. These include convergence programmes, competitiveness and employment programmes and territorial cooperation programmes and they are financed from the budget lines of the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the European Neighbourhood and Partnership Instrument.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0585"></a>

<p>In contravention of EU nature conservation law Malta allowed spring hunting of certain migratory birds in 2004, 2005, 2006 and 2007.</p>
<p>In March this year the European Parliament adopted a resolution (<a href="/doceo/document/TA-6-2007-0074_EN.html">P6_TA(2007)0074</a>) on hunting and trapping of migratory birds in Malta, urging the Commission to redouble its efforts to persuade the Maltese authorities to comply fully with Community law.</p>
<p>Why did the Commission fail to heed this parliamentary recommendation and to take the next official step in its infringement proceedings against Malta to halt spring hunting? Furthermore, can the Commission explain how it will ensure that spring hunting does not occur in 2008?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The infringement procedure to which the Honourable Member refers relates to non-compliance by Malta with the hunting provisions of Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#defann_32_1" name="refann_32_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> (the Birds Directive). The non-compliance in question concerns an annual spring hunting season for the hunting of two species, Quail (Coturnix coturnix) and Turtle Dove (Streptopelia turtur). The problem is one which presents itself on an annual basis, during the months of March, April and May, corresponding with the period of the spring migration for the birds.</p>
<p>In this case, the Commission launched infringement proceedings under Article 226 of the Treaty, sending to the Maltese authorities a Letter of Formal Notice in June 2006 addressing the breach of the Birds Directive and a supplementary Letter of Formal Notice in March 2007. Responses from the Maltese authorities to both Letters were subsequently received in April 2007.</p>
<p>In view of the need to assess the detailed information provided by the Maltese authorities under the infringement procedure, no decision as to the next possible step in the infringement procedure has been made yet. In addition, the Commission also sought to assess whether the decision taken by the Maltese authorities in May 2007 to prematurely end the spring hunting season (permitting 30 days spring hunting rather than 40 days) indicated a change in policy by the Maltese authorities.</p>
<p>If, in light of the information provided by the Maltese authorities, the Commission considers that the grounds for the breach remain, the Commission will continue the infringement procedure in accordance with the Treaty.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
