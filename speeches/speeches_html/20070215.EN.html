<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Cristobal Montoro Romero (PPE-DE), </span></span>  <span class="italic">rapporteur</span>. <span class="bold">– </span><span class="italic">(ES) </span>Mr President, Commissioner, Mr President of the European Investment Bank, the report we are debating today falls within the framework of dialogue between two European institutions.</p>
<p class="contents">This dialogue is producing positive results, as demonstrated by the presence of the European Parliament, in a spirit of cooperation and appreciation of the important work of the European Investment Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">We have been working on this report for months. We began on 20 June of last year and that work also involved our visit to the headquarters of the EIB in September.</p>
<p class="contents">Also fruitful has been the work we have carried out with the various political groups, with all of those that have tabled amendments. We reached an agreement on the inclusion of those amendments with the Socialist Group in the European Parliament, with the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, with the Union for Europe of the Nations Group, with the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance and with the Confederal Group of the European United Left – Nordic Green Left. I would like publicly to thank those groups for their willingness to cooperate. This made it possible for the draft report to be approved unanimously by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs on 23 January.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB is doing a good job, and we take a positive view of it, within the context of a year like 2005, when the European economy was relatively stagnant and we had the sense that the structural component of our economy, its growth potential, was, in relative and comparative terms, lower than that of the other developed regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">This is an important approach to take when assessing the EIB’s economic actions. Those actions, ultimately aimed at enhancing the European Union’s physical resources in the form of infrastructures, make it possible to improve the Union’s growth potential. The new approach, which has been present in the EIB’s activities since 2005, geared towards small and medium-sized businesses – which unquestionably form the European Union’s backbone – is another positive approach, which we welcome and which will be implemented accordingly.</p>
<p class="contents">We believe that the main focuses of its action, that is to say, to promote the European Union’s economic and social cohesion, the Innovation 2010 initiative, the protection of the environment, the development of the trans-European networks and the contribution to the European external cooperation and development aid policy, have been carried out in a satisfactory manner.</p>
<p class="contents">In the report we introduce a first suggestion, which is to question whether the EIB has sufficient resources to implement such ambitious policies. As a public Bank, the EIB is comparatively small when compared to the public Banks of the countries making up the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the principal objectives, we advise the EIB to continue working particularly in the least-developed regions, with a view to promoting ‘catching up’. We also recommend that it focus its investment efforts on those less developed regions, on projects relating to innovation and the knowledge-based society.</p>
<p class="contents">Our report also emphasises – of course – energy, the energy components, improving the security of supply and the freedom of the market. The EIB can contribute here as well. Also with regard to the funding of the trans-European networks, which are absolutely crucial — as I said earlier — to the structured development of the European economy.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, with regard to foreign policy, we appeal to the EIB since we believe that the volume of loans granted to Latin America is insufficient, compared to external activities in other regions of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the methods for intervention, we welcome the intensification of cooperation with the Commission on programmes that are already underway. We are pleased with the volume of resources allotted to small and medium-sized businesses, and we would insist that this is a fundamental aspect that we must continue to improve in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">We must also stress the improvement in access to information and the transparency of operation, which the Bank is clearly improving. The report contains a positive assessment in this regard and also encourages the bank to continue with that transparency, genuinely subjecting its accounts to the Basel II criteria and, through better communication of its work, to provide its users with better information, beginning with the European Union’s financial intermediaries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">With the enlargement of the European Union involving 10 countries in 2004 and completed on 1 January of this year with the accession of Bulgaria and Romania, with the greater interdependence of economies and within a context, in 2005, of budgetary fragility in most of the Member States, the European Investment Bank represented, in the year covered by this report, and still represents today, a fundamental instrument for responding to the ever-increasing funding demands to be met by the European Union’s policies.</p>
<p class="contents">This is demonstrated by the new instruments implemented within the Union’s budgetary framework for 2007-2013, or the extension of the Bank’s external mandate approved by the Ecofin Council a few months ago. Notable amongst those instruments are the risk-sharing finance facility, which will enhance private sector investments in research and development through greater access to the Bank's funding, the guarantee instrument for the trans-European transport networks, or the contributions to the cohesion policy by means of the JASPER programme, in cooperation with the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development, and the JESSICA programme, in cooperation with the Council of Europe Development Bank.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, the European Investment Fund, integrated into the EIB group, will increase its contribution to the Union’s objectives thanks to its involvement in the new European competitiveness and innovation programme, and also thanks to the increased opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses to access funding within the context of the JEREMIE programme, in conjunction with the Structural Funds.</p>
<p class="contents">In the external field, the main feature of the European Investment Bank’s new external mandate is that it is being brought more into line with the Union’s external action priorities. In this regard, the Bank’s resources for action in the Mediterranean, by means of the FEMIP and in the neighbouring countries, by means of the new investment fund, and the tripartite agreement for action between the Commission, the EIB and the EBRD, have been strengthened.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB will also have greater resources for acting in areas such as Latin America and Africa. All of these developments are taken up in Mr Montoro’s report and the Commission sees them as extremely important and positive. They are all evidence of the central role played by the European Investment Bank in achieving the Union’s objectives and the constructive spirit of dialogue prevailing between Parliament and the Bank is therefore very good news.</p>
<p class="contents">I can only add for my part, as Commissioner responsible for relations with the European Investment Bank, the Bank headed by Mr Maystadt, that cooperation has been excellent, and I hope it will continue to be so. I am sure that it will. And I am sure that this cooperation between Parliament and the Bank, between the Commission and the Bank, will make it easier for us to achieve our common objectives — those of the Commission and Parliament — for the future of the European Union. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

First of all, I would like to praise the European Investment Bank’s activity. In the course of 2005 they made more than 50% of their own loans accessible to small and medium-sized enterprises, which employ two thirds of the European labour force. I hope the JEREMIE programme, which has recently become operational, will reach its goal, namely, easier credit for micro, small and medium enterprises.</p>
<p class="contents">Similarly, the JASPERS programme will be of great assistance to Member States in the preparation of major projects. Of the three JASPERS regions covering the twelve new Member States, only the Warsaw centre has been inaugurated. Hopefully, the other two regions will also soon be activated, but I still cannot understand what the second region’s centre is doing in Vienna which is not even part of the programme, instead of choosing cities perfectly suitable for the tasks and concerned by the region’s activity, such as Budapest, Prague or Bratislava.</p>
<p class="contents">In the matter of harmonising industrial objectives with environmental ones, Europe is not doing badly, though there is still work to do. In and of itself, one could even rejoice in the fact that 30-35% of bank loans were invested in projects targeting improvements in natural and built-up environments. However, 60% of these loans ended up in urban projects while only 20% remained for improving energy efficiency.</p>
<p class="contents">In order to eliminate differences at Member State levels in the field of energy, the cooperation of the banking group is indispensable. Let me cite my own country, Hungary, as an example: according to the findings of Eurostat, of all the Central and Eastern European countries, the Hungarian State spends the least on energy saving and energy efficiency measures. Until 2013, a mere 10 billion Forints, as compared to the magnitude of 100 billion for gas-price subsidies. So we still have things to do together to improve the situation. Finally, I congratulate the rapporteur. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like, however, to highlight the positive view that Parliament has once again taken of the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB) and in particular its governance model.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB has managed to enhance the quality of its activities while strengthening both the transparency of its operations and the openness and the loyalty with which it deals with other institutions, particularly the European Parliament. From time to time the EIB makes commitments to improving the quality of the services it provides and to meeting new interim targets as part of its fundamental mission; it has always succeeded in meeting these strategic objectives. We now hope that the EIB once again responds positively to the suggestions and recommendations made in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, it is very important that the Bank’s financial activities continue to be geared towards support for projects aimed at promoting energy efficiency and at developing renewable energy sources, with the Bank committing itself to attaining even higher levels. It must also be capable of significantly increasing support for economic and social activities outside the EU, namely in Africa, Latin America and in the Mediterranean associated countries.</p>
<p class="contents">As the report says, the EIB cannot and should not compete with private intermediary financial institutions, when those institutions are ready and able to finance projects. It is essential, however, that the institution remain committed to the objectives of the Lisbon Strategy on growth and employment and that it fulfil the specific, practical responsibilities arising from this commitment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore vital to strengthen its activities in funding infrastructure and in supporting the most vulnerable areas of manufacturing, which is now made up of the thousands of SMEs that operate in the European market and that create a substantial proportion of the jobs. One of the EU’s key missions is to foster economic and social inclusion and, as the Union’s financial institution, the EIB has a key role to play in achieving this objective. These are probably the most important messages that Parliament can and must use this opportunity to convey, given that support for the Bank’s activities and judgments on their quality are not, on this occasion, at issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should also like to congratulate the President of the European Investment Bank, who is here today. He represents the largest investment bank in the world. The EIB has a very good reputation, and the EU can be proud of the important role it plays on the world stage by virtue of this Bank. This is partly thanks to President Maystadt himself and his communicative role, whose influence is felt in the political sphere.</p>
<p class="contents">My role as rapporteur for the Competitiveness and Innovation Programme (CIP) – the key programme for innovation in Europe – has shown me how crucial the role of the EIB is for innovation. In the shape of JASPERS and JEREMIE, the Bank has launched further instruments to help it really build on innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw how the EIB also played a key role in reaching a compromise on the budget by virtue of the ‘Risk Sharing Finance Facility’ – I have to use these English terms, unfortunately – so warm thanks for this as well. We could not have adopted our budget without the Bank’s contribution.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to add, however – and this also goes for my fellow Members from Mediterranean countries – that we should pay more attention to innovation in the field of cohesion, too. Merely supporting cohesion will not help in the context of a Lisbon Strategy based on innovation. We must ensure that the focus of all projects is on innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">The EIB should also explore new paths. I should like to raise the issue of patents in this regard. Europe has very few patents compared with the USA, and, in particular, very expensive patents compared with China. In this context, the European Investment Bank could play a key role in funding patents for small and medium-sized enterprises. A conference was held on this subject recently, at which the EIB was represented via the European Investment Fund. The EIB and the EIF voiced their strong support for this, as did Parliament, but the Commission was a little hesitant. We must go down this route, however, if we are to raise awareness of innovation among SMEs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to turn to the major issue of energy. I am delighted that the EIB has already assumed a prominent role in an issue that will be huge in coming years. The Bank supports a multitude of projects, particularly in the field of pipelines, and will continue to be crucial here in future, as our energy strategy can only be realised if the Bank retains an active, leading role in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to mention the issue of projects outside the EU. The rapporteur calls for an increase in the funds for Latin America. This alone will not do. We must make it possible for the EIB to provide financing anywhere in the world where European strategic projects are being carried out – such as Beijing airport. This is of paramount importance to us Europeans. The EIB should be the anchor point of the European support landscape, and it is Mr Maystadt’s job to ensure that this is the case. The relationship between the EIB and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (Council of Europe bank) must also be clarified. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The bank’s <span class="italic">raison d’être </span>is the promotion of business. New opportunities and tasks are emerging for the bank in European Union energy policy and in the Lisbon Strategy spheres of growth and employment, especially employment, where financial support has not been allocated for the tasks proposed. I would like to commend the bank’s decision to change direction in its policy on funding projects from quantity to quality; this will require more analytical work, but will definitely be better for the development of competitive business. The European Investment Bank’s refusal to participate in funding the Baltic Sea gas pipeline project, which has been viewed in conflicting lights, can be seen as a highly considered decision not to get involved in projects which weaken solidarity within European energy policy. The bank’s mission is and remains to foster the European Union’s economic and social cohesion. I endorse the request made in the report, with regard to economic and social cohesion, that the bank should concentrate on the least developed regions – Objective 1 regions. The bank has not always done this in implementing its loan policy. The bank’s activities to promote the inclusion of the least developed regions in the knowledge-based economy, and its endeavours to develop financial instruments that can be used to support small and medium-sized enterprises are especially to be endorsed. I welcome the fact that the bank has taken on the role of financial catalyst in the financing of Europe’s communications networks. In attracting private capital the bank’s participation in the financing of the connection of cross-border energy networks will be particularly important, where the complicated financing procedure makes it difficult to attract private capital. At the same time the bank could play a greater part in attracting private capital to various investment projects, by offering increased opportunities to assess investments in connection with projects in which the bank is participating or plans to participate. The development of the bank’s structure has not fully mirrored the European Union’s enlargement process and, as the report indicates, the bank has no permanent delegation in the Baltic Sea region. I agree with the request put forward in the report for the bank to improve its communication policy and to translate the main information on the bank’s website into all the European Union Member States’ languages.

This unanimity in our committee is a clear illustration of Parliament’s complete satisfaction with the European Investment Bank’s (EIB’s) attitude to us since 1999, when I had the honour of being Parliament’s first rapporteur on the Bank’s activities.</p>
<p class="contents">It might be said that we have succeeded in establishing permanent links between our two institutions and in ensuring a symbiotic relationship between, on the one hand, the wishes of the MEPs, who often pass on requests from associations and NGOs, and, on the other, the policies of the EIB, which, on the basis of our recommendations, has increasingly come into line with the Gothenberg-Lisbon Strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">This year, as well as noting that the objectives have in the main been met by the EIB, I should simply like to draw attention to the difficulties that we cause the Bank via our demands. Mention has just been made of the Baltic oil pipeline. It is true that as soon as we demand the highest security when it comes to sustainable development, decisions need to be made on our objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">There is another, more complex, problem. We ask the Bank to lend more to SMEs; in other words, we ask it to find operational provisions enabling small businesses and relay banks to implement the objectives that we set for the Bank. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We have to bear in mind that the Bank’s primary task is to provide capital for projects in the Member States of the European Union. The Union supports loans to third countries, which may be regarded as part of the EU’s external policy. For that purpose, the EU gives the EIB a general mandate regarding guarantees for loans granted to external countries. Thanks to the EU’s guarantee, the aided countries receive loans at interest rates lower than those on the market. As for the view expressed in the report that the loans granted to countries in Latin America represent a small proportion of the total, I would point out that the EIB’s primary task is to finance projects within the EU.</p>
<p class="contents">When it approved the new mandate on guarantees for external loans in December, Parliament at the same time said it wanted to participate in the setting of priorities for loans. Parliament unanimously called for the legal basis of the mandate to be changed so that it would better reflect the nature of development aid and simultaneously give Parliament a voice in the setting of priorities. The Council was not prepared, however, to change the legal basis. It is the opinion of the Committee on Budgets that Parliament should therefore bring an action against the Council in the Court of the European Communities.</p>
<p class="contents">The committee’s report focuses attention on support for SMEs. They are effectively supported by the European Investment Fund, whose rise in share capital is at present being debated by Parliament. Parliament is likely to support the proposal, with the EIF’s share capital being increased in line with a suggestion by the Commission. That means that SMEs will get extra cash, which is one response to the demands made in this report. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Sadly, I cannot share this enthusiasm. That sounds a bit ungrateful; after all, the UK, which is far from being one of the poorest nations, seems to do pretty well out of it.</p>
<p class="contents">In 2005, we received EUR 3.979 billion in loans, which is 9.4 % of the total loans made to projects in the Member States. But the truth is that Britain is being loaned a lot less than it pays into the EU. In 2005, even after deducting the rebate we paid GBP 3.6 billion into EU coffers; that is about EUR 5.4 billion. That is not exactly value for money.</p>
<p class="contents">I have no problem with some of the projects being funded, such as the East London railway upgrade scheme, or improved water supplies here and there. But, of course, the wind farm off the Cumbrian coast is a waste of money.</p>
<p class="contents">The point is, if Britain were not in the EU, it would be able to finance these schemes without any loans and with money to spare. So we would be a lot better off and we would not have to fly that wretched flag with its ring of stars. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

În aceiaşi termeni consider şi raportul privind activitatea desfăşurată în anul 2005 de către Banca Europeană de Investiţii pe care, îl apreciez ca fiind unul care îţi lasă, după lecturare, o stare de bine. Remarcabil este faptul că autorii s-au străduit şi au izbutit să prezinte de o manieră clară, atât activitatea desfăşurată în perioada de referinţă, cât şi programele de perspectivă menite să răspundă marilor provocări actuale cu care se confruntă Uniunea Europeană şi nu numai. Din lipsă de timp o să mă limitez doar la câteva remarci în legătură cu unul dintre aceste programe, şi anume cel referitor la promovarea coeziunii economice şi sociale în interiorul Uniunii Europene, în special în zonele puţin dezvoltate.</p>
<p class="contents">Un program generos, însă, fiindcă există un însă, având în vedere că raportul face referiri şi la zonele mai puţin dezvoltate ale spaţiului european, din care face parte şi România, m-aş fi aşteptat ca programul să conţină de o manieră mai concretă şi un eventual sistem de facilităţi precum termene de graţie, dobânzi încurajatoare şi altele, care să permită ţărilor din aceste zone recuperarea mai rapidă a decalajelor în vederea accelerării procesului de integrare în Uniunea Europeană.</p>
<p class="contents">Recent, unul dintre membrii marcanţi ai conducerii Băncii Europene de Investiţii a făcut o vizită în România unde a fost primit la toate nivelurile decizionale. Nutresc speranţa că după această vizită, paleta programelor pe care instituţia ce o conduce le va dezvolta în România va cuprinde şi altele care, împreună cu cel privind coeziunea economică şi socială vor contribui de o manieră mult mai consistentă la definitivarea şi pe această cale a procesului de implementare completă a legilor economiei de piaţă liberă şi concurenţială specifică ţărilor Uniunii Europene. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate comes at a good time for the EIB. In recent weeks, the subject that will presumably be the chief preoccupation of the next generation, or generations, has taken its place at the very top of the political agenda at long last: climate change. In this connection, I should like to suggest that the EIB review all its activities to identify the projects still receiving its support that we already know will rebound on us in the end on account of climate change. In what areas can the EIB be significantly more active? Here I am of course referring to the energy action plan in paragraph 6 of this report.</p>
<p class="contents">A much more fundamental approach can be taken to this. The EIB has a unique opportunity to make it quite clear that there are far-sighted European projects, too. Renewable energy is an infinitely large field, as is transport. The institution should advertise the fact that it saw the light in time on this, so that we can say in 10-15 years’ time that, back then, the EIB was indeed forward-looking in the loans it supported.</p>
<p class="contents">This brings me to paragraphs 19 and 21 of the report. I would ask the EIB to ensure that the funds do reach the final beneficiaries rather than seeping away or becoming stuck in intermediary banks. I ask it to concern itself with the environmental framework. Incidentally, it is my opinion that we are in urgent need of less EU red tape and more democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We all must confront one basic challenge, namely, the modernisation of the internal market of an expanded Europe. I would say that the internal market of Europe can be characterised by the popular economic term 'transition economy'. Such economies are typified by uncertainty, risk, new challenges and a rapidly changing situation. I consider, therefore, that the European Investment Bank needs to be bolder in offering new financial instruments, and I would like to emphasise that the European Investment Bank operates in this direction in the fields of both borrowing and investing, especially in non-euro countries.</p>
<p class="contents">Another aspect of importance to 'transition economies', which I know from my own experience, is that it is necessary to teach market participants how to use these instruments. A good many projects – very good projects – go unfunded from lack of knowledge. I would like to mention the well known <span class="italic">Jeremy</span> project for small enterprises, and the <span class="italic">Jasper</span> and <span class="italic">Jessica</span> projects. These will not be effective unless the Bank, which has acquired a large amount of information, shares this information and pays significant attention to technical support. Perhaps the Bank's remoteness, requiring it to operate through representatives in the regions, does not permit the Bank's input to be felt at the level of the ordinary citizen, the small enterprise or the small city. I hope that the Bank will value the opportunity of making its solutions more accessible to individual citizens and regions.</p>

For some time now, the bank has endeavoured to implement projects in line with the Lisbon Strategy, and I believe the positive effects of these projects will be felt in the near future. Nonetheless, I should like to make a few comments concerning the EIBs activities.</p>
<p class="contents">Firstly, I must point out that the fundamental aim of the EIB is to support social and economic cohesion throughout the Member States of the European Union. Accordingly, a significant proportion of the bank’s funds should be devoted to the poorest regions of the European Union. Nonetheless, as the rapporteur rightly pointed out, in the course of the last four years, and including 2005, the inverse was the case. The so-called Objective II regions received most of the support, to the detriment of the less economically developed Objective I regions.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, there is a marked tendency on the part of the EIB to support the southern regions of the European Union, at the expense of its eastern ones. The same is true in the case of countries that are not members of the Union. The bank can be rightly proud of the many projects undertaken within the framework of the so-called Mediterranean neighbourhood policy, but I was unable to find a single project undertaken within the framework of the eastern neighbourhood policy on the bank’s web site.</p>
<p class="contents">My last comment concerns the assessment of the effectiveness of projects undertaken by the bank. It seems clear to me that the bank should undertake <span class="italic">ex post</span> assessment of the results it achieves, measured in terms of economic growth and job creation. In particular, I agree with the rapporteur that making information and analysis on unsuccessful projects available could be helpful. It could identify indicators that would be useful to the bank when making decisions on the implementation of further projects in the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

As Mr Maystadt rightly said, in November last year, this is a major issue to which the international financial community should respond. Competitive lending is an undesirable phenomenon, since its eventual effect is to reduce all conditions on loans to a minimum, at least provided that there are any conditions left in the areas of democracy and human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">Does the EIB think it might join with the international financial community in bringing pressure to bear on China? Considerations of human rights and democracy should not be made secondary to short-term economic gain, not even in Chinese credit policy in respect of Africa. While this House, in a resolution on relations with China, is making a powerful plea in favour of freedom and human rights, we would lose our credibility if we were not to prescribe these requirements as conditions for loans in the African countries. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Philippe Maystadt, </span></span>  <span class="italic">President of the European Investment Bank</span>. <span class="bold"> </span><span class="italic">(FR)</span> Mr President, I should first like to thank your rapporteur, Mr Montoro Romero for his extremely thorough analysis of the activities of the European Investment Bank (EIB). Mr Montoro Romero put in a great deal of personal effort: he came to the Bank, asked a great many questions and, with the help of his colleagues, has produced a report that gets to the very kernel of the EIB's strategic objectives.</p>
<p class="contents">These strategic objectives are encapsulated perfectly in the motion for a resolution, and I can inform you that the Bank unreservedly accepts the recommendations contained therein. As regards the priorities covered in paragraphs 2 to 10 of the motion for a resolution, we shall be pursuing our activities according to the proposed guidelines, including in the field of energy. The latter was rightly addressed by a number of speakers, and I can tell you that in the Business Plan for the next three years, we have decided to lend at least EUR 4 billion per year for energy-related projects, including at least EUR 800 million for renewable energy sources.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, we have set ourselves one rule, which will, admittedly, not be easy to observe, but this is the rule we have set ourselves: we want at least half of the new production capacity for electricity that we shall be called on to fund to be linked to renewable energy.</p>
<p class="contents">A further axis of our activities in the area of energy will of course be that of improving energy efficiency. I have taken note of Mr Turmes’ specific proposals. I can tell him that, in several Member States, we are already funding social housing renovation programmes so as to improve energy efficiency, and are naturally ready to broaden our activities in this area, which, as you said, is crucial to our future.</p>
<p class="contents">Still on the recommendations in the first part of the motion for a resolution, mention is made of the EIB’s representation in the Nordic countries, an issue also raised by Mr Krats. I can confirm to him that the EIB has in principle taken a decision to open a representative office in the Nordic countries. The interested Member States are working together and once an agreement has been reached between them, we shall be opening the office.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst on the subject of the EIB’s external offices, I noted Mr Olajos’ question about the EIB’s new offices in regions particularly affected by the Jaspers programme. We have decided to open three new offices. The first, in Warsaw, is already open, and the two others, in Bucharest and Vienna, will be open in the next two months. Mr Olajos wondered why Vienna had been chosen; he mentioned other possibilities, such as Budapest, Prague and Bratislava. Vienna was chosen because the Member States concerned were not able to reach agreement, and so Vienna appeared as the compromise choice.</p>
<p class="contents">To return now, more systematically, to the different forms of cooperation with the Commission mentioned by Mr Almunia, I wish to say to you that there are three important new initiatives: the Jeremie Programme, which is a very original programme for transforming the structural funds into renewable financial instruments; the Jaspers Programme to which I have already alluded, which is a form of technical assistance to help identify and prepare major projects that can be financed by the structural funds; and lastly, the Jessica Programme in the area of urban renewal.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, still with the Commission, we have finalised a new guarantee fund for funding trans-European networks and a research facility, as mentioned by Mr Katzimarkakis, which forms part of the new financial instruments that Mrs Starkevičiūtė was seeking. This is just one example of innovations in the area, and should enable us, I repeat, to act, in conjunction with the Commission, as a lever to help markedly increase funding for research and innovation.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of speakers mentioned the role that the European Investment Fund could play. The Fund will expand still further with support for SMEs thanks to increased capital currently in preparation and thanks to an extra envelope of EUR 1 billion, via the ‘competitiveness and innovation' framework programme, leading to more innovative financial products benefiting new-start small businesses in particular.</p>
<p class="contents">These are the remarks I wanted to make, Mr President. I can in any event confirm to you that, having read the motion for a resolution very carefully, we are prepared to implement its recommendations. Furthermore, if Parliament so wishes, we would be ready to draw up a report in one year’s time on the state of play regarding the implementation of these recommendations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I support his proposals aimed at expanding the role of our public bank in order to facilitate the functioning of the internal market and to enhance the Union’s external role. I am disappointed, however, by the scant mention of financial aspects, in particular the reasons why the Member States have not released their contribution to the capital, amounting to EUR 155 billion. This situation leads to an obvious lack of capital and in turn to a lack of scope for action.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bank owes its outstanding marks solely to the fact that its stakeholders are the 27 EU Member States and that it enjoys Community budget guarantees on a great many of its financial commitments.</p>
<p class="contents">On this subject, I cannot explain why this Community guarantee is not always paid back transparently, transparency being an objective of the Bank praised in the report. It will be interesting to examine the Bank's voluntary implementation of the solvency ratio (Bâle II), the method used to implement it, and the aggregates making up this ratio. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title4"></a><a name="creitem4"></a>

I should also like to thank Mr Almunia for his encouragement on various occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, we recently heard the Commission President say in Parliament that Europe cannot aspire to speak to the world with one voice on energy policy when, internally, it is utterly incapable of speaking with 27 voices. This is also probably the most important message contained in the report before us, and this message has a clear target: the European Council and the Member States, and the Spring Summit in Brussels on 8 and 9 March is an appropriate date for that message to be heard. The time has therefore come to move from mere statements of intent to action, a change of attitude that must take place now or it will never happen.</p>
<p class="contents">Now is clearly not the best time for us to go into a detailed analysis of the nature, the causes and the consequences of the various energy crises that we have suffered. The report has much to say on these issues and even if it did not we would all still be able to recall the distinguishing features of each of the four oil crises that the European economy has had to contend with in the past 50 years. It is clear that both from the point of view of the new economic paradigm – what might be termed ‘globalisation’ – and from the political and strategic perspective – what might be termed the ‘absence of multilateralism’ – the situation today is vastly different from what it was in the middle of last century. Yet it is precisely for that reason that we must be intelligent and humble enough to acknowledge that different problems always require different solutions and that the most complex problems require the most ambitious and radical solutions.</p>
<p class="contents">It is undeniable that the turbulence we have seen in the energy markets and the volatility of prices has led to slower economic growth and to steeper price rises. It is also unthinkable that these setbacks have not been made worse by intense speculative activity around the price of raw materials in the energy sector. It is obvious that strongly integrated economic areas, as, fortunately, is the case of the EU, are able in the short term to absorb shocks and to pursue their main objectives by implementing their economic policies appropriately. Yet it is also true that the slowdown in the pace of growth and the loss of competitiveness are inevitably reflected in fewer jobs being created; moreover, the current lack of job creation will never be offset by the jobs that may be created in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">The EU is made up of Member States with differing growth rates and manufacturing structures, and accordingly their levels of dependency are very different. The difficulties experienced by some Member States will always have to be added to the global difficulties experienced and be paid for by the whole economic and political area to which they belong.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has warned us of an unavoidable outcome unless measures are taken immediately. Europe’s dependency in this sector will increase to unsustainable levels by 2030, and we all know that such dependency will come at a price, in terms of not only the economic impact but also the political and strategic relations that will become entrenched in the years ahead.</p>
<p class="contents">The issue of energy is therefore one of central importance for the future of Europe and it is above all a political issue requiring political and Europe-wide responses and commitments. Even the more technical issues, such as the discovery and development of new alternatives and the creation of interlinked regulation systems, can only be successfully addressed if approached from a supranational perspective, without which it will be impossible to mobilise the enormous financial resources needed for research and development.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore suggested that the Union, via its institutions, engage in a global debate on the issue designed to generate interest among the economic agents, the bodies representing the sector and the citizens. It should then go on to assess the true impact of using different energy sources, and the possible combinations thereof, on economic growth, on environmental protection and on reducing the detrimental effect on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">At this stage, as recent events have shown, the Member States on their own are not in a position to tackle these problems. What is needed is a proper, shared European energy policy, as the Commission has suggested, although that will depend entirely on the Council saying that it wants one. As we know, not only is the EU dangerously dependent on the energy it imports, but it also has not, as a whole, guaranteed the security of production of the energy it needs to meet its objectives of growth and the well-being of its citizens.</p>
<p class="contents">Much can be done inside the European area, through energy savings, promoting efficiency, diversifying sources and protecting the environment. Yet the crucial objective can only be achieved via dialogue with all of the other regions of the world, including both those that are predominantly energy producers and those that consume increasing amounts of that energy. The EU’s foreign policy in this new century needs to incorporate the energy dimension as a priority, and for this to be successful it should be based on three essential axes: solidarity with the EU and its structural principles and values, solidarity with developing countries and solidarity with the environmental dimension of the world in which we live and without which we cannot survive.</p>
<p class="contents">By adopting this report, Parliament will, as on previous occasions, be demonstrating its desire and honouring its responsibility to take action in an area that is essential to the citizens’ well-being, in spite of all the difficulties. We would like to hope that the Spring Summit of the Heads of State or Government is characterised by progress and is not limited to well-meaning statements that do not solve any of the current problems and that only serve to create or store problems for the future. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It is a very complete report in terms of its content and it is particularly timely when the European Council of 8 March is about to discuss a broad energy package approved by the Commission in January.</p>
<p class="contents">That package includes a proposal for a global European strategy capable of taking on the challenge of guaranteeing the energy supply while at the same time combating climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">The fact that, over recent weeks and months, the oil price has fallen back from maximum levels of close to 80 dollars per barrel, which it reached last summer during the Lebanon crisis, does not mean that the main conclusions and recommendations contained in the report are no longer as relevant.</p>
<p class="contents">Those conclusions and recommendations place the emphasis on the structural factors that have led to the recent price levels, or current price levels. These factors are undoubtedly going to remain in place.</p>
<p class="contents">However, in view of the growth and inflation figures for 2006, which have been released over recent days, it is worth stressing how well the European economy has reacted in general to the volatility and rises in oil prices this year.</p>
<p class="contents">I agree with the concerns expressed in the report with regard to the consequences of the increase in prices, but it is also the case that, over recent months, those consequences have been less serious than we had feared and than those that we have seen in previous cases of sharp increases in oil prices.</p>
<p class="contents">This is something that should be stressed. It is linked to the debate we held yesterday in this House on the Bullmann and Andersson reports. It is significant that, at a time when the European Council is going to discuss both this energy strategy and climate change package and the Lisbon Strategy, our European economies have experienced a period of sharp oil price increases and that, at the same time, economic growth has sped up without any particularly worrying tensions in prices.</p>
<p class="contents">As I said yesterday in this House, this is not the result of chance, it is the result of efforts made over recent years to make the functioning of Europe’s markets in goods, services, capital and labour more efficient, and it is the result, beyond the cyclical element of the current economic situation, of the positive results that we are beginning to see thanks to the structural reforms already carried out, and thanks to the budgetary consolidation efforts of recent years.</p>
<p class="contents">This message must reach the citizens loud and clear so that public opinion may be in a position, on the one hand, to appreciate the importance of the efforts that we have asked them to make so far, and, on the other, to better understand and accept the efforts that have still to be made in order to ensure that the improvements that we are now beginning to see become structural improvements and allow us to look to the future with more confidence.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I would say once again that this better behaviour of the economy does not make the report and the conclusions and recommendations of the report by Mr dos Santos, in particular, any less relevant in terms of the functioning of the energy market and the impact of energy consumption on climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">We must not ignore a series of factors. For example, that Europe’s energy supply is dependent on geopolitical factors, which are not entirely in our hands. For example, that the low level of interconnection of our gas and electricity energy networks makes us more vulnerable to those geopolitical factors and to tensions in supply, such as those we have seen this winter and the winter before.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, that that low level of interconnection, together with other factors of a national nature, make it impossible for a genuine internal energy market to emerge. This harms consumers, who pay more for energy, receive lower quality energy and have less security in terms of receiving that energy at acceptable prices and quality.</p>
<p class="contents">Or, for example, that the amount of CO2 that we continue to emit into the atmosphere is exacerbating the greenhouse effect and the consequences of that effect in terms of climate change.</p>
<p class="contents">In my view, the response to the problems and challenges referred to in the report, some elements of which I have just listed, can largely be found in the proposals included in the energy package approved by the Commission in January and which is going to be one of the principal issues to be discussed at the European Council of 8 and 9 March.</p>
<p class="contents">Our proposals cover both economic and environmental aspects, security aspects stemming from our energy dependency and proposals to improve the efficiency of energy use. In this regard, I believe that they are essentially in line with the considerations and recommendations contained in the report by Mr dos Santos.</p>
<p class="contents">All we need to do is move on from debate to action. The citizens are aware of the challenges we have to face. At the forthcoming European Council, the Heads of State or Government must now provide the necessary political impetus to implement a genuine European energy strategy such as the one put forward by the Commission in its proposal, and like the one that this Parliament has been calling for repeatedly, in today's report and in other reports and resolutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On behalf of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, I welcome a heightened interest in these issues, but let us please be cautious about trying to solve all issues in the energy field in this report which, as I understand it, is primarily about oil prices and oil volatility.</p>
<p class="contents">The first point I would like to make relates to the precedent of the oil price shocks in the 1970s, when a substantial increase in real terms had a big effect on the economy, but the world financial markets coped with those changes and the recessionary effects were relatively short-lived. The increases today in proportion, in real terms, are not as great, and therefore should not give us such concern.</p>
<p class="contents">What is new are the different suppliers in the marketplace, and in particular Russia and the Russian policy on this matter. I have great confidence in the markets. I think that they will cope with changes in demand in the foreseeable future, but that is a very short period of time and our concerns should be more about security of supply; about getting enough supply, whether it is within Europe or imported; about a depletion of reserves; and about the sustainability angle, with reference to climate change and our emissions. Those are very important and we must remember that we do have alternatives to oil, but we need to develop them to a marketable stage.</p>
<p class="contents">I would be very cautious about trying to increase the proportion of oil stocks from 90 to 120 days. I do not think 30 days more will make any difference. This House voted strongly against a proposal from the Commission to that effect in the last Parliament. I wonder whether our main concern is really fear about price changes. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is undisputable. It would be going too far to speak of a recession, however, as the rapporteur would have liked.</p>
<p class="contents">This report is one year old, and I am very much obliged to Mr dos Santos for incorporating our contributions into the report now present. This means that we have eliminated all our differences on this and acted according to the state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">When it comes to this subject, what we need is not heated debates, but rather a sober analysis. The oil price increase has naturally led to certain increases in production costs. Yet it is wrong to assume a direct link between energy prices and competitiveness on this account. After all – as the Commissioner has just said – the increase in the price of fossil fuels has been universal, and thus the competitive starting position of our competitors has been equally affected.</p>
<p class="contents">Oil prices are calculated in US dollars. In this connection, I warmly welcome the fact that the European Central Bank is proceeding with caution in monetary matters whilst remaining vigilant. Yet it must be borne in mind that rising oil prices promise oil-producing companies an increase in profit. This, in turn, leads to the development of more areas, to increased supply and ultimately to a fall in prices – which is what we have seen in the last six months. If the situation in Iraq were more peaceful, the uncertainties in Iran removed and the Caspian Sea oil flowing, the outlook for the medium term would be better.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we improve the organisation of our energy supply in future? This will be discussed shortly – with our participation – and an objective analysis will help in this discussion. As we know, Europe relies heavily on fossil fuels – of which there are few sources in Europe – and so it is desirable to develop renewable energies. Developing these at all costs, however, will have the same negative impact as rising oil prices, as the cost of these new technologies will be passed on to the final consumer. This will mean less money in the Member States’ coffers for other fields.</p>
<p class="contents">We need more investment in research and development to make renewable energy supplies more competitive and ready for the market. In terms of the energy issue, this is the only course of action that will help the European economy. If I may make an additional comment on the medium-term outlook: the situation regarding China will become clear in the medium term. Looking at the progression of its economy, particularly the automobile industry, China will need as much energy for its cars by 2030 as is being produced today. This means that we need new technical possibilities. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Obviously, we must focus on the economic problems, but the main point that I would like to stress is that, ultimately, these economic problems lead to social problems. For many countries this oil price crisis has ultimately led to a greater financial burden on those who can least shoulder it. I would like to quote Malta's case as an example, where the authorities' lack of planning has led to a 45% surcharge on water and electricity bills. I also believe that we must start thinking outside the box and look beyond the framework we have been confined to up until now. These new prices have led to certain solutions that until recently did not make any economic sense. However, now they do make sense and we must pay more attention to them than we did previously.

The rising price of energy is pushed up further by the increased requirement for energy resources of new major market participants, especially China. Furthermore, energy resources are made more expensive by the increased cost of their production, and by the geopolitical instability of petroleum-exporting regions. Rising costs are also influenced by Russia's policy of using energy as an instrument for exerting economic and political pressure on its trading partners. This year, world petroleum prices have increased by almost 15%. In addition to the factors I have already mentioned, other influencing factors were the OPEC decision to reduce petroleum production, and unexpectedly cold weather in the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">As mentioned in the report, energy price increases, as an external factor, caused repercussions in the economies of various EU countries, both in the euro zone and among the new member countries. My country, Lithuania, whose economy depends very much on the import of energy resources, exceeded the Maastricht inflation criterion by 0.07% due to an unexpected rise in energy prices and, therefore, failed to become a member of the euro zone, as it was hoping to do from the beginning of this year. Increases in the cost of energy resources cannot really be predicted, and this will have an influence on the possible admission dates of candidates to the euro zone, apparently pushing them further into the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Do we just observe the influence of rising energy costs on the EU economy or do we need to draw conclusions from it? If the price increases were sudden and unexpected, and objective, then why are just the member countries being blamed for the consequences? Europe only started talking about a common energy policy after the Ukraine-Russia crisis of 2006. The conflict between Belarus and Russia at the beginning of this year over natural gas and petroleum appears to be successfully resolved for the moment.</p>
<p class="contents">It is pleasing that the report contains a whole chapter urging Europe to act now and invest in innovation, the energy infrastructure, renewable forms of energy, technology platforms and a transition to clean energy. I am of the opinion that, given the energy situation in the EU and the world, and our concern not just about the prices but also about the influence on climate change, we should also discuss the use of safe nuclear energy as we celebrate the fiftieth anniversary of Euratom this year.</p>
<p class="contents">The author of the report urges that the greatest priority be given to the creation of an energy market for Europe proper and the Mediterranean basin. What is 'Europe proper'? What ever happened to neighbourhood policy, embracing cooperation not only with Mediterranean countries but also with the eastern neighbours of the EU? Why is the European Union negotiating with Russia, trying to arrange a new Treaty of Cooperation between the EU and Russia? Do we decline to accept Russian petroleum and natural gas since we do not have a common EU energy market? I believe that the new eastern EU member countries find the author’s narrow view unacceptable. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In this regard, I welcome the contribution of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, which expressed its opinion extremely clearly and supported the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">Where we disagree, including in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, is on the speculative aspect that has been added to this Structural Fund. From that point of view, I very much endorse the words of Mrs Budreikaitė, and hope that she can persuade her group to withdraw the amendment disputing the speculative element on the volatility of the price of energy. We need to take measures to combat volatility. We must at least eliminate the speculative element of movements in the price of energy, and are capable of so doing.</p>
<p class="contents">That being said, we must be aware of the particularly serious impact of the structural rise in the price of oil. A grass is invading the planet, namely the African palm, a cereal crop used in biofuel or biodiesel production, which will lead to the price of food being linked to the price of energy. This is an unacceptable risk that we cannot afford to run.</p>
<p class="contents">For years we have been wondering how to ensure that workers do not suffer from the second wave of the effects of oil on the cost of living. If, by dint of an extraordinary misfortune, the policy of developing biofuels were to lead to competition with food production policy, the result would certainly be a link between the price of food and the price of energy, and that would be the most terrible disaster. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We will in fact get to the point where we reserve our oil, but will we do it far-sightedly and voluntarily or because prices force us? What will decide the question? Well, the answer lies in the way we support European R&amp;D and the way we scale up European production of alternatives, not in the way we take alternative oils from other countries.</p>

I am a member of the League of Polish Families, and my party was opposed to that war from the very beginning. Many families and households across Europe are now feeling the negative consequences of high energy prices, and the prospect that prices will remain high in the foreseeable future is resulting in fundamental economic changes.</p>
<p class="contents">The suggestion that current minimum European Union duties on diesel oil might be increased from 2012 is also cause for concern. That type of solution, and the harmonisation of provisions, so typical of Union bureaucracy, neither fosters improved competition, nor does it help to eliminate the differences between European countries. Instead of working on raising prices, the European Commission would be better employed supporting alternative sources of energy, energy saving technologies and renewable sources of energy.

In the course of the present debate on European energy policy there are frequent mentions of the noble goal, also contained in the report: within the next few years the European Union must complete its own internal energy market. There is, however, one vital prerequisite for this to happen: that a healthy, undistorted competition should govern the markets within individual Member States as well.</p>
<p class="contents">Unfortunately, however, the recent sector review by the European Commission demonstrates that the European energy market is made up of over-centralised national markets. The old monopolies are still such dominant players today that they dictate or at least strongly influence prices.</p>
<p class="contents">In Hungary in the 1990s, the incumbent MVM Company Ltd. and the newly privatised electric energy producers signed long-term electricity purchase agreements. These agreements, due to expire between 2010 and 2020, cover about 80% of the Hungarian electrical energy production market, thereby seriously hampering the liberalisation of the market and keeping consumer prices unreasonably high. The price that MVM pays most generating plants for the contracted energy supply seems considerably higher than the wholesale price MVM would pay if power generating plants had to compete with each other. The legal provision for renegotiating these agreements has not led to any result so far, and so the unsatisfactory functioning of the energy market continues to cause serious disadvantages to consumers.</p>
<p class="contents">Ladies and gentlemen, a real internal energy market is crucially important for reaching the goals of Europe’s energy policy. Free market competition reduces costs for citizens and businesses, promotes energy efficiency, encourages investment and also contributes to supply security. All Member States must therefore dismantle market impediments without delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Макар и с известно закъснение, Европейският съюз трябва да предприеме редица мерки в дългосрочен и в краткосрочен план, за да преодолее енергийната си зависимост, както по отношение на количествата, така и по отношение на цената на внасяната енергия и енергоносители.</p>
<p class="contents">Важно е да бъдат подкрепени политически и финансово големите инфраструктурни проекти, които ще диверсифицират източниците и ще увеличат входните трасета за внос на петрол и газ.

Надявам се, докладът dos Santos да бъде подкрепен, защото изпълнението на предложените в него мерки ще допринесе за икономическата стабилност, социалната сигурност и външнополитическата тежест на Европейския съюз и на страните-членки. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I welcome this excellent own-initiative report, which makes it abundantly clear that Europe must, as a matter of urgency, take proactive, coherent action.</p>
<p class="contents">The development of the internal market for energy has not eliminated existing distortions, as demonstrated by the Commission’s inquiry into the sector. Accordingly, Community regulation of this market needs to be improved by monitoring existing production and distribution structures, and strengthening links between countries. These are some of the conditions that must be in place if we are to increase efficiency in the energy market. It is crucial that the energy efficiency plan recently put forward by the Commission be adopted, as it addresses all of these issues.</p>

<p class="contents">There is no doubt that we will continue to talk about energy and we will continue to talk about it in direct relation to climate change and the strategy required to combat it. Energy policy cannot be separated from environmental policy. They form part of the same strategy. I believe that from a debate such as today’s, and other debates that we have held and that we will continue to hold on these issues, today’s more focussed on prices, others on other important aspects of this strategy, the conclusion is — at least this is my conclusion, and I believe that the majority of Members of this Parliament will agree with me — that action at European level, a common European policy, is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a field in which European-level action demonstrates, when it is discussed, and will demonstrate, when we communicate it to the citizens, the added value of European Union action for the coming years and decades. From the point of view of security of supply, from the point of view of the sustainability required of any policy in the field of energy, and from the point of view of the quest for greater competitiveness within a context in which energy prices are unfortunately not going to be as low as they have been in the past, from all points of view, action at European Union-level is essential.</p>
<p class="contents">I shall therefore conclude this debate, Madam President, by joining in the appeal that many of you have made this morning for more decisive action, firstly by the European Council of 8 March and, on that basis, by all of the European institutions, to achieve objectives such as those laid out in the report by Mr dos Santos. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also reflects our economy’s excessive dependence on oil, the price of which has shot up whilst the prices of other forms of energy have remained stable or have risen by less.</p>
<p class="contents">We must take account of a complex situation and effect a political response revolving around the following points. The first is the emergence of European energy leaders, because they alone are capable of negotiating on an equal footing with our main suppliers for the benefit of our Member States. They must be able to go on concluding long-term contracts so as to secure supplies and to cushion heavy investment. Finally, they must not be weakened by the recommending of all-out separation of assets as a factor of competitiveness in the market. Such separation does not make for competitiveness.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point is promotion of a genuine energy mix based on renewable energy sources, nuclear energy, energy efficiency and increased budgets for research into the energies of the future such as ITER.</p>
<p class="contents">Preparing for the post-oil era, these policies will enable the Union to remain competitive while ensuring generally affordable energy supplies for its economy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr></table></td></tr></table><br /><a name="title5"></a><a name="creitem5"></a>

I wish to begin by thanking the Committee on Legal Affairs, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and, in particular, the two rapporteurs Mr Lehne and Mr Klinz for their excellent work on this file.</p>
<p class="contents">The compromise package that is now on the table contains very effective solutions to the problems that we have identified, without imposing excessive burdens. These problems, which led the Commission to submit its proposal, were in principle very simple: at the moment shareholders do not receive information on general meetings in time, they face restrictions on trading their shares for a certain time period ahead of the meeting if they want to vote and they often have to go in person to general meetings, even if those meetings take place in another Member State, as there are no effective rules on representation and distant voting. Together with Parliament and the Council, we managed to find simple solutions to these simple problems.</p>
<p class="contents">However, we cannot stop there. In particular, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs pointed out, in its opinion of November 2006, other issues that need to be addressed if we want to make the general meeting work efficiently and if we want to further improve the corporate governance of European companies.</p>
<p class="contents">We have already identified stock lending as something we should look at more closely in the context of the future Commission recommendation on shareholders’ rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree that another important issue here is to clarify the role and the duties of financial intermediaries. In today’s financial world, investors depend heavily on intermediaries to provide them with information and voting services if they want to exercise their voting rights. This point has also been stressed by delegations in the Council. The Commission has already undertaken to examine this question thoroughly in the impact assessment to the future Commission recommendation. I think all the parties involved agree that this issue is too important to address without having examined all available opinions and without having carried out a full assessment of the possible consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">You might ask why we are considering using only a recommendation in order to tackle these problems. The reason is that the practical processes that are relevant in this context are constantly developing, also due to the constantly improving technology. We do not want to set the current situation in stone, but wish to leave enough flexibility for adjustments. The Commission recommendation will give us this flexibility.</p>
<p class="contents">My colleague Mr McCreevy therefore confirmed last month, in a letter to the Chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, our intention to address this issue, together with others, in the context of the work on the recommendation. I hope you share our view that this is the right way to render the provisions of the draft directive even more effective in practice. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is concerned with deepening the European internal market, and one aspect of this is giving owners the opportunity to exercise their rights across borders in this internal market. The Committee on Legal Affairs adopted this important project unanimously. We have come to an agreement with the Council whereby, if this House follows the vote of the Committee on Legal Affairs in plenary, the Council will do likewise, and thus we shall be able to achieve a result here at a single reading pursuant to the Interinstitutional Agreement of December 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">The first crucial issue with which this Directive is concerned is that of the representation of shareholders at general meetings; that is, the exercise of voting rights not by the shareholders themselves but by intermediaries – representatives – or by means of proxy voting.</p>
<p class="contents">There are widely differing rules for this in the EU, some of them highly restrictive. The compromise reached in the end makes representation possible in principle, but subject to a transparent procedure, and also gives the Member States the opportunity of prohibiting representation by national law in the event of conflicts of interest.</p>
<p class="contents">A second important area is the issue of the right to ask questions. The problem here is that the traditions and, in particular, related legal consequences, rights of challenge and similar points vary greatly between Member States. The scale ranges from Member States where questions can be asked but do not need to be answered, to Member States where questions have to be answered correctly and, if they are not, resolutions adopted at general meetings can be declared null and void.</p>
<p class="contents">A compromise has been reached on this that lays down the right of shareholders – owners – to ask questions in principle, but does enable Member States to make sensible adjustments and also limited restrictions to the right to ask questions in accordance with their own legal traditions, without calling this right into question in principle.</p>
<p class="contents">As Commissioner Almunia mentioned, a number of issues could not be resolved definitively with this Directive. This is partly owing to legal systems. An example is the legal relationship between shareholder and representative. Indeed, this has no place in a Directive concerned with company law, as matters such as this belong in contract law, which is why the Council and Parliament subsequently agreed to deal with it in a separate recommendation, a separate legal act.</p>
<p class="contents">The same goes for the subject of the languages used. In this regard, the co-rapporteur Mr Klinz from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs had made the – undoubtedly constructive – suggestion of providing for similar rules to those in the Transparency Directive. Here, too, however, we later decided – following the negotiations – that, in systematic terms, it would be better to regulate this within the framework of a recommendation than in this specific text. Consequently, this issue, too, will have to be resolved in the separate legal act.</p>
<p class="contents">All in all, I should say that, from my point of view, we have managed to solve the multitude of problems that existed when we started dealing with this Directive. It is true that they have not all been solved one hundred per cent satisfactorily, there is no question about that – this is normal when one has to reach compromises. Ultimately, however, they have been solved in a way that enabled the solution to obtain unanimous support in both the Council and the Committee on Legal Affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like to express the warmest of thanks to my co-rapporteur, Mr Klinz, to the shadow rapporteurs from the two committees concerned – but particularly to Mr Medina from the Committee on Legal Affairs, with whom I enjoyed close cooperation – to the two Chairs, Mr Gargani and Mrs Berès, to the Austrian, Finnish and German Presidencies, which contributed significantly to the success of this project, and last but not least to the European Commission, whose help with overcoming the problems was very useful. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That is what this Directive sets out to change and improve.</p>
<p class="contents">The objective is welcomed and shared by all parties, and so I had reckoned with relatively simple, short negotiations as rapporteur for the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs – but reality taught me otherwise. Thanks to the peculiarities of the bodies of company and civil law of the 27 Member States, and also cultural differences – some of them major – the negotiations between the Commission, Parliament and the Council were protracted and difficult and ultimately produced only minimum harmonisation.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, there has been some very tangible progress, as Mr Lehne has already said. Share blocking is to be abolished, cross-border proxy voting liberalised and electronic means permitted. These measures will undoubtedly make it easier in future for those with cross-border share ownership to cast their vote at general meetings.</p>
<p class="contents">Agreement has yet to be reached on a solution to some key problems, however, which the Commissioner has also mentioned. I particularly regret the removal from the Directive of the definition of the shareholder and the role of intermediaries in cross-border depository chains. The issues of stock lending, the language to be used and the special position of investment funds have also been left out. These are fields where minimum harmonisation is particularly necessary if we are to really establish a genuine European share culture.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am pleased that the Commission intends to address and take up this subject specifically in the form of a recommendation. The provisions agreed give the Member States broad scope for action, and so we shall probably have to live with different rules – some of them substantially so – in the individual Member States for many years to come.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that the approach of minimum harmonisation that has been chosen does not risk diluting the whole project. Only experience over the next few years will show whether attendance at general meetings actually increases perceptibly and thus the main objective of the Directive can be achieved. That would certainly be of great benefit in terms of corporate governance. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Secondly, while I am pleased that Commissioner Almunia is with us, I believe that this would have been a good opportunity to hold a personal exchange of views with Commissioner McCreevy, because, as has been highlighted in previous speeches, there are questions about the limitations of this proposal for a directive.</p>
<p class="contents">It is a minimal proposal for a directive, about which there are a series of question marks. For example, with regard to the issue of financial intermediaries, the legitimate rights of shareholders and the use of proxy, that is, the right to vote by means of a representative.</p>
<p class="contents">The text that Mr Almunia has read to us on behalf of Mr McCreevy talks about a future Commission recommendation. The problem with recommendations is that they raise difficulties from the point of view of Community law.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr Lehne has said that we are talking about provisions of the Treaties, but at the moment we in the European Parliament are concerned about the over-use of the systems of so-called ‘soft’ law by the Community institutions, which raises questions about the reliability of the Law. I have the feeling that this issue will have to be discussed.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that, at meetings with the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, Commissioner McCreevy will clarify his ideas a little so that we can ascertain what we can do in order to reassure ourselves that progress is going to be made in a particular direction.</p>
<p class="contents">We Socialists are rather concerned about the protection of the rights of shareholders. We are concerned about the possibility that, in a great European Union market, financial operators will act with total impunity and freedom, and I have the sense that this is an important issue for everybody, for investors and for savers, which should be subject to full consideration and discussion between Parliament and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">We will therefore vote in favour, but I would say once again that I hope Mr McCreevy can discuss the methods for making future changes in the legal field with us. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At present, citizens of several Member States of the European Union who hold shares in companies quoted on the stock exchange, and whose registered office is located in another Member State, experience significant difficulties in exercising their voting rights. As the process of European integration gathers momentum and the internal market grows, the amount of cross-border capital investment is increasing, which is a good sign. It suggests that integrated financial markets are becoming established in Europe. This process should be encouraged, which is why the Commission recommendation on the directive deserves our support today.</p>
<p class="contents">The document under debate contains many important proposals devised to make it easier for shareholders to exercise their rights. I should perhaps mention the need to ensure that sufficient notice is given when convening all general meetings. It is also important to ensure that interested parties have easy access to information announcing meetings and the results of votes taken in them. Providing for proxy voting is another important issue, along with measures to make it easier for intermediaries to act for shareholders. These are the kinds of solutions that will make it possible to restrict certain types of share blocking. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There are many essential elements concerning this report which we can all get behind, particularly in protecting the rights of shareholders and making the process transparent. It is nice to hear the transparency directive mentioned — which I worked on before. However, from a legal point of view its treatment is slightly different from the approach of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, where strong opinion found in favour of certain key issues, in particular necessary distinctions required in dealing with intermediaries and stock lending when, in particular, shares were repatriated in order to allow for owners to vote.</p>
<p class="contents">The timing is vital and we are surprised, therefore, that Amendment 26 to Article 7 does nothing but confuse the situation. What happens to these shares – are they to be deposited? Transferred? Registered? What? There seems to be nothing there which allows for specific requirements. There are no specific requirements or references to them concerning the sale of transferred shares. Might this not lead to certain further confusion?</p>
<p class="contents">There are also amendments from the ECON Committee which I have to say have been subject to what I deem the ‘recital effect’ by the Committee on Legal Affairs and to the ‘letter effect’ by Commissioner McCreevy, who suggested that later developments on these issues should be expected. Let us be frank. Nobody likes to be told that their amendments are reducible or that they can be ignored. The ECON Committee is an equal player and its remit allows it to be so. I can only say that the process has been unsatisfactory in that regard, which is partly the reason for this debate today.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope we can come back to these issues in the ECON Committee with the Commissioner to repair some of these problems mentioned in our ECON opinion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I will not repeat what others have already said on this, but what I would like to stress here is that if as a parliament we have codecision rights on a dossier, we should take every opportunity to really assess what comes out of informal negotiations with the Council and Commission in a codecision procedure which is likely to go to a first reading agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">This is why we were a little upset that this dossier is already being dealt with in this sitting rather than in March as had been planned. We would then have been able to discuss an oral question with Commissioner McCreevy about ‘one share, one vote’. I hope that we will still have this opportunity and that the Committee on Legal Affairs will also support us in having this further debate with Commissioner McCreevy.</p>
<p class="contents">On the content, the essential difference between a recommendation and a legislative text is precisely this codecision. A letter from Commissioner McCreevy to Mr Gargani, the chairman of the Committee on Legal Affairs, announces that some of the issues we were concerned about will be dealt with in a recommendation. The last line says, ‘You will be informed about this one as a parliament’. This is the exact point we are making. We would like to be co-legislators on that type of issue as well. This is the reason why we are not really happy that some of these issues could not be taken up in the agreement with the Council. Maybe if we had had more time we could have also convinced the Council that this kind of issue, which is of major concern, could have been included in the first reading, second reading or conciliation agreements. These are my comments on what happened today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I believe that the work which we began in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and which, following many discussions, culminated in the agreement before us today, was worthwhile on two counts, first and foremost on the definition of the term shareholder, which, in the form proposed by the Commission, was too broad. This led us to embark on a definition of securities law that was very close to the practice in force on the other side of the Atlantic, which does not correspond to our traditional notion of what is a shareholder. I feel that a narrower, tighter definition, such as we are proposing today, is the right way forward.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point on which we have been led to amend the Commission's proposal is the issue of the process of reattaching voting mandates. On this issue, too, I feel that, thanks to the work undertaken in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with our rapporteur, whom I wish to thank, we were able to emphasise the existence of compulsory instructions in the event of a mandate: an obligation to observe and retain these instructions.</p>
<p class="contents">To this end, I feel that in addition to the question of cross-border rights for shareholders in this report, the Commission would be better off looking equally closely at what is important in terms of employee share ownership or the stability of shareholders in certain industrial situations regarding which, from a European perspective, we would favour a coherent strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I should like, if I may, to take this opportunity to ask you again, Commissioner, about the Commission’s position on the Hague Convention. This issue forms an integral part of this debate. Parliament asked you to withdraw the Commission’s signature under the Convention, and the debates in the Council have clearly not moved on very far. I should like to ask you, Commissioner, to talk to Mr McCreevy again and to tell him that this House wants the Commission to rethink its position on this issue and to withdraw the European Union's signature from this Convention. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">800 000 small shareholders, still accounting for some 90% of the company’s capital, believed the promises of the tunnel’s designers, of the public authorities, the bankers and the manufacturers and invested some EUR 4.5 billion in the company.</p>
<p class="contents">They are now ruined, and will be damaged even further by a ‘rescue’ plan, which consists of selling the company to non-European shareholders at basement rates and reimbursing its creditors, which have already earned EUR 8.5 billion in interest. This plan was drawn up without consulting the shareholders and has been imposed on them by the Paris <span class="italic">Tribunal De Commerce</span> (Court of Arbitration in Business Matters). The only choice open to them is to respond or not to a takeover bid, which will keep them forever sidelined when it comes to capital and, by extension, to business decisions, at the very moment when the business is becoming extremely profitable.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a shameful episode, and the silence of the French authorities is scandalous. All of this serves to dissuade people from investing in the economy, thereby leaving it to the mercy of the large, stateless, financial groups. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Almost fifty years during which several European countries have made great efforts in the area of development aid and north-south cooperation. Half a century, with mixed results.</p>
<p class="contents">Why? For several reasons. One reason is the lack of appropriate development strategies on the part of the countries receiving aid. This is why I voted in favour of the report on budgetary aid for developing countries, that is to say, aid directly managed by the government of the benefiting country. In this way, it is that government that will assume responsibility for its own development, following dialogue with the Union and the drafting of a strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">I am well aware that this instrument is a controversial one, especially when it is to be used in fragile countries with unstable economies, and of course when the countries concerned are undemocratic or corrupt.</p>
<p class="contents">It cannot therefore be used everywhere. The success of budgetary support, however, is about breaking the vicious circle. The conditions leave no room for doubt: no budgetary support without observing standards of governance and without fighting corruption; no budgetary support without measures aimed at cleaning up the economy. The more points a government scores for good governance, the more aid it receives. This is about creating a virtuous circle. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The fact that this illegal fishing cannot be prevented leads to losses and poverty for their coastal populations that depend on fishing for a living and for a secure source of food.</p>
<p class="contents">At the same time, these illegal practices lead to direct losses for legitimate fisheries operators as well. In this regard, I would like to stress once again that one of the virtues of the association agreements in the fisheries sector between the European Union and other countries is that Community deep-sea fishing fleets have accepted the code of conduct for responsible fishing, promoted by the United Nations, and that their presence in those waters also means that other illegal vessels do not act with such impunity.</p>
<p class="contents">Therefore, being in favour of renewing all the fisheries agreements with third countries, since they offer significant mutual benefits for both parties, I have voted in favour of the plan to eradicate illegal fishing, because it poses a serious threat to the biological balance of the oceans, and that represents a great environmental risk that we cannot afford. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One of the essential prerequisites for improving bilateral relations is to facilitate the legal movement of people. At this point, I should like to point out that the Russian Federation proposed to the EU the bilateral lifting of visa requirements. Following the rejection of that offer, an agreement was reached in complicated negotiations covering short-stay visas for citizens of the Russian Federation and the Community, except for citizens of three of the EU Member States. This is something of a pilot agreement because negotiations are ongoing on a similar agreement with the Balkan countries, Ukraine, Morocco and China. The agreement contains a number of positive points, such as visas to be provided free of charge for holders of diplomatic passports, multiple visas, timeframes for issuing visas and fees for visas.</p>
<p class="contents">Naturally, this agreement is a long way short of visa-free relations, and the quick and problem-free issuance of visas free of charge. Some comments made in the debate in this Chamber indicate that there are a number of MEPs with vested interests in the issue. Attempts are being made, on the one hand, to revive the corpse of the European Constitution and, on the other hand, to use the agreement to interfere in Russia's internal affairs. These attempts were mostly repelled and were not included in the visa agreement. We therefore support it in the belief that this is the first step on the road to visa-free relations with one of the EU’s key partners. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">I should like to remind the House that Russia was the first subject of the so-called joint strategy presented to the European Council in 1999. Even at that time it was clearly stated that Russia should be firmly anchored in Europe and that Russia must not be viewed merely as a threat or as an inferior or troublesome partner. Taking account of both this overview and of current events in Europe and around the world, I cannot accept the idea put forward in the report on the readmission agreement that relations between the EU and Russia are going through a critical phase and that the new partnership and cooperation agreement after 2007 will depend on the perceived human rights situation in Russia. Russia is not a superpower which wages wars and tramples human rights underfoot across every continent. Those who criticise human rights abuses wherever they occur, and not only in Russia, should first ensure that they themselves strictly uphold human rights. The fact that this is not the case is evidenced by the situation of the Russian non-citizens living in the Baltic States. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Following the uproar caused by the Commission communication on a sustainable European wine industry, and in particular the decision to eradicate 400 000 ha of vineyards, it was necessary for the European Parliament to present its views of future reform of the wine sector in this report.</p>
<p class="contents">What is vital, in my opinion, is to preserve the budget of the Community, and not to shift any funds from the first to the second pillar of the common agricultural policy, which is devoted to rural development, as this might lead to resources being lost to the wine industry. On the other hand, it is necessary to support the market position of wine and the wine industry by establishing a realistic advertising, communications and marketing policy based on joint organisation of the market. I firmly believe that the Commission can devise efficient draft legislation only by making proper provision for the proposals from the European Parliament aimed at preserving the leading position worldwide of quality wines produced by the European wine industry, which is still a significant source of employment and prosperity in quite a few European regions, including Slovakia. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This led us to vote against the final report, although we agree with, and voted for, a number of the rapporteur’s proposals.</p>
<p class="contents">We are dismayed that the main measure proposed in the Commission communication for regulating supply and demand in the winemaking sector is the grubbing up of 400 000 hectares of vine, which will reduce production and jobs will be lost. This will in turn serve to exacerbate the desertification of vast areas, as has already happened in Portugal, and to place the wine and alcohol sector into the hands of a few major producers and large companies.</p>
<p class="contents">These are measures aimed at reducing the EU’s vineyards, which would affect primarily the least developed regions, family holdings and farmers on low incomes, but they will have little impact on the rise in imports and the declining role of winemaking in the EU Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">We shall continue to defend our proposals and to combat the Commission’s proposal to liberalise the sector. What we are proposing is a different type of reform of the common organisation of the market in wine that values sustainable winemaking, the traditional characteristics of winemaking, small and medium-sized farming and family farming, the sector’s social and cultural role, and its important contribution towards regional and national development. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The provision that it makes for the grubbing-up of vines is liable to affect entire areas devoted to this production and also to irremediably damage the growing of indigenous vines which, while not very widespread, nonetheless represent centuries-old history and traditions.</p>
<p class="contents">The constant increase in wine production and quality in the so-called ‘New World’ countries (South Africa, Australia and South America, where vines are, by contrast, being planted), the increasing presence of these wines on the European market and the fact that worldwide demand for wine is on the increase make the idea of grubbing-up all the more incomprehensible. Europe needs to be able to compete with its competitors on equal terms.</p>
<p class="contents">With a view to optimising European wine production and wine-making, I have tabled an amendment on behalf of the Union for Europe of the Nations Group that underlines the need to maintain the ban in Europe on using the new wine-making practices for ageing wine (such as the use of oak shavings instead of the traditional period spent in the barrel). </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The report does acknowledge that over the past six years, since the introduction of the euro and the Lisbon Strategy, there has been weak economic growth, stagnation and even recession in some Member States, including Portugal. It recognises that economic recovery cannot be taken for granted, that unemployment remains high (17 million in the EU) and that poverty has gone up 2 percentage points. It also considers it unacceptable that there are almost 80 million poor people in the EU. Moreover, it acknowledges weak internal demand and the need for greater investment.</p>
<p class="contents">It contradicts itself, however, when it says that the euro and the internal market have been crucial victories for European progress, and promotes monetary policy (wage moderation), the deregulation of the labour market (flexicurity) and the Stability and Growth Pact. Reading between the lines, we can see its true purpose – to create a climate that is most favourable to entrepreneurial activity. The current economic and social policy guidelines pursued by the EU have been championed again and the contradictions of the social democrats and their role in liberal capitalism have been laid bare. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Experience suggests, rather, that the single currency has been downright damaging in relation to stabilising the economy and has had few positive structural effects.</p>

At the same time, the rapporteur continually points out that certain countries succeed much better than others in various areas.

Unlike the oil crises of the 1970s, which were caused by a breakdown in supplies, the current ‘crisis’ has arisen, on the one hand, from increased demand on the part of developing countries such as China and India, and of the biggest consumer in the world, the United States, and, on the other, from predictions that this ‘finite’ resource will be in short supply in the medium term.</p>
<p class="contents">Living with higher oil prices worsens recession and balance of payments difficulties, results in higher production costs, inflation and interest rates, penalises families on low incomes and causes wars over control of the oil supply, as in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">If technological solutions can contribute towards increasing energy efficiency, and towards finding new forms of fuel and energy, it is vital that we change the capitalist mode of production, which causes waste and inefficiency. The answer lies in reducing GDP energy intensity, in promoting high-quality public rail transport and in promoting production for local markets.</p>

<p class="contents">Fuel prices have hit the fisheries sector particularly badly. Its operating margins and economic viability have been significantly affected, thus exacerbating the socio-economic crisis in the sector. Between 2004 and 2006 alone, the price of fuel went up by around 100%, and in some parts of the sector fuel accounts for some 50% of total operating costs.</p>
<p class="contents">Fishermen have seen their incomes go down, which is particularly serious as the sector is mainly concentrated in regions with fragile economies. Various studies warn of the risk of thousands of fishing businesses and thousands of jobs disappearing on account of fuel price rises.</p>
<p class="contents">Urgent, extraordinary measures must therefore be taken to support the sector, for example the creation of a guarantee fund, with Community participation, in order to stabilise fuel prices.

The Tibetans embody their own culture in inhospitable living conditions, isolated and high up in the mountains. For a long time, China has been unable to resist the temptation to consider that region as a fall-back that can absorb sections of its own very large population.</p>
<p class="contents">This is a problem not only for the people of Tibet, but also for those of the neighbouring and more readily accessible region of Xinjiang, home to the Uighurs, who are related to the Turkic-speaking peoples, such as the Kazaks, Kyrgyzs and Uzbeks. They fear becoming minorities in their own countries and losing everything that is dear to them. Moreover, we should certainly not idealise the traditional living conditions of Tibetans and Uighurs. Although sweeping changes are called for, these changes should not be imposed from outside or, what is more, serve outside interests.</p>
<p class="contents">Since China is the world’s most populated country and an up-and-coming economic power, it is extremely unlikely that Tibet will be given the opportunity to develop into an independent state. This makes it all the more important that, 50 years after the major conflict, there should be a reconciliation in which, within China, the Tibetans are allowed to retain the most valuable traits of their individuality and they no longer run the risk of becoming the victim of state violence. These days, the progress ideology that has dominated China for nearly 60 years is mainly focused on economic growth. Although this has drawbacks, it does offer more scope for tolerance and recognition of diversity than was the case for a long time. A dialogue or cultural individuality and self-governance within China should pay off. My group is in favour of anything that can contribute to this dialogue and to peaceful solutions. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">This Parliament has shown that it is not naively utopian in urging the importance of political and commercial relations with the Chinese regime. In this Chamber, nobody wishes to deny the real significance of such relations; nor is there any need, however, to commit the opposite error, and that is to ‘poison’ a line of action that is clearly highly popular, not within the institutions but with the people. The Tibet issue and support for dialogue are matters which enjoy the support of the people of Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">Our support is undeniable, but we should also ensure that this support becomes practical.

<p class="contents">China has an enormously positive role to play in world affairs. Just one example: China made a vital contribution to the success of the six-party talks on North Korea just yesterday. We can use this as an example and as a lesson. If China can make a positive contribution through structured dialogue to regional peace and stability, then we can also engage China in a dialogue which will help to create a climate of confidence that will allow for a pragmatic solution to the Tibet issue. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Do they mask an inability to act, or do they at least contribute to confidence-building? Parliament is rightly calling for the resumption of the dialogue, last conducted one year ago, between the representatives of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government. Items on the agenda should include the elimination of reprisals, an end to human rights violations, and tangible measures to guarantee the Tibetan population cultural and religious autonomy.</p>
<p class="contents">The dialogue was launched in September 2002. China has been blocking it for 12 months. The grounds are always the same: preconditions are to be met; the Dalai Lama is not interested in improving relations, and is striving for Tibetan independence. This is simply not true. For years, His Holiness has been interested not in an independent state, but in Tibetan autonomy. There are good examples of this kind of legal status even in the EU. The Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats stands by four positions, as do almost all other groupings in this House. Firstly, an EU Special Representative for Tibet must be appointed. It is insufficient that this issue be relegated to the fringe of EU–China dialogue. Secondly, we want the Commission to make Tibet an integral part of the EU–China Partnership and Cooperation Framework Agreement. We ask that the Commission inform Parliament of progress and retrogression. Thirdly, the Council should include in its annual report information on current developments with regard to the China–Tibet dialogue. Fourthly, the EU should draw up joint strategies with its partners in the world, particularly the USA.</p>
<p class="contents">It is my fervent hope that the representatives of the People’s Republic of China understand the desire of the international community – as just expressed by my fellow Members – for China to resume this dialogue with the Tibetans at long last. After all, China’s representatives are most preoccupied with good press in the run-up to the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

More than once we have expressed support for the commitment of the Government of the PRC and His Holiness the Dalai Lama to resolve the issue of Tibet by means of dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the European Parliament, which in the past has adopted more than one resolution on Tibet, on the human rights situation in the People's Republic of China and likewise on dialogue between the PRC and the Dalai Lama's representatives, must urge the European Council, the Commission and European Union member countries to actively support the intensifying of this dialogue and to seek a result. While no tangible results have yet been obtained in the resolution of these basic questions, Parliament should – in consultation with both parties – evaluate what further role the EU can play in seeking to facilitate a solution of the Tibet issue by means of negotiation, and it should appoint a special European Union envoy to Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">I support the position of the resolution we are considering that the Senior Commissioner and the Council's Secretary-General be encouraged to include information about progress on the dialogue between the PRC and representatives of His Holiness the Dalai Lama in 2007 and also in later years in the Annual Report to Parliament on General International and Security Policy.</p>
<p class="contents">I think the country currently presiding over the Council – Germany – could initiate and accept a declaration that would show how the European Union might assist in achieving a peaceful resolution of the Tibet question through negotiation.</p>
<p class="contents">In conclusion, I would like to thank Mr Thomas Mann and other colleagues who initiated the resolution being considered today.</p>

So far, however, the resolutions we have adopted have not led to any tangible results. The same is unfortunately also true of the consultations that have been taking place between the Tibetans and the Chinese Government since 2002.</p>
<p class="contents">The problem of Tibet remains unresolved. In the meantime, over 1 200 000 of the six million Tibetans have lost their lives under the Chinese occupation that began in 1951. Every year, some 3 000 inhabitants of Tibet flee their country. These are mainly children and young people, who can only obtain a Tibetan education abroad. The Tibetan people are discriminated against in every area of social life, from education through to social care, work, living conditions and religion.</p>
<p class="contents">We must act in solidarity and exert pressure on the Chinese Government, so that the dialogue is resumed as soon as possible and the status of Tibet regulated. The European Commission should raise the matter of discussions with the Dalai Lama during negotiations on the new Partnership and Cooperation Agreement between China and the Union. For its part, the Council should define the Union’s role in resolving the Tibet issue, as the outcome of the negotiations between China and Tibet should be reflected in the Council’s annual report to Parliament on the implementation of the European Union’s Common Foreign and Security Policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">In essence, the core issue of dispute between the people of Tibet and China has been the wish of the Tibetans for self-determination, as opposed to the Chinese Government’s fear of a possible domino effect leading to the break-up of China.</p>
<p class="contents">In fact, such a problem has been the commonest cause of disputes worldwide. However, history has shown that by far the best and most effective way to solve such problems is through peaceful and open negotiations with a prerequisite determination on the part of all concerned to find a lasting solution. The alternative way – that of endless confrontation and bloodshed – usually leads nowhere and is, in most cases, to the detriment of both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">With this in mind, we would warmly welcome a commitment by both the Government of China, in particular, and the Dalai Lama to resolve the Tibet question through a process of dialogue, and wholeheartedly hope that such a process, if brought about, will lead to a successful resolution of the Tibetan problem. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Nevertheless, I am one of those who believe that the responsibility of each of the two parties for the fact that an agreement has not been reached cannot be compared.</p>
<p class="contents">The Dalai Lama, as the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, has demonstrated his desire for dialogue and agreement on more than one occasion, and he has even given up his demand for complete independence in favour of a genuine autonomy that guarantees respect for the ethnic, linguistic, cultural and religious identity of Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">In this regard, I believe that it is the Chinese Government that should show greater signs of willingness and at least accept a resumption of dialogue with a view to reaching a good final agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">I would therefore urge the European Commission, the Council and the Member States to take every possible opportunity to support a new round of dialogue between China and Tibet. In particular, as others have said, it is essential that we take advantage of the negotiations of a framework agreement on European Union-China cooperation, which began on 17 January, to express the Community’s commitment to dialogue and a fair and lasting solution to the issue of Tibet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is very unfortunate that the rule in these situations seems to be that of <span class="italic">Erst das Fressen und dann die Moral</span>.</p>
<p class="contents">When reading the relevant resolutions, which reflect not only the positions of the different groups in connection with this dialogue, but also the stance of official Europe, I, as a Fleming, do have some reservations.</p>
<p class="contents">Politicians who, yesterday and the day before that, while discussing the Fava report, brandished international law and insisted on human rights – which they were right to do – are now suddenly talking about the need to respect China’s sovereignty, whilst not breathing a word about the illegal occupation and subsequent annexation of Tibet, about the mass human rights violations, the ever increasing exclusion of the Tibetans from their local government, or the Namdrang Rangdrik programme, launched in 2005, whereby Tibetans are forced to demolish their houses and subsequently rebuild them according to strict official guidelines.</p>
<p class="contents">The sanctimonious line is that a mutually acceptable solution must be found for Tibet’s future. To say that is to make victim and executioner equal partners in dialogue. It became once again evident on whose side the EU is when in November 2005, the Chinese President, Hu Jintao, was received with much pomp and circumstance across Europe, yet it had, in fact, been he who perpetrated serious human rights violations when he was Secretary of Tibet’s Communist Party between December 1988 and March 1992.</p>
<p class="contents">The Tibet issue once again demonstrates that European rhetoric all too often amounts to nothing but moral wrapping paper and that in reality, only economic interests matter. We must continue to have the courage to denounce the cowardice and sanctimoniousness of this Europe, of this mercantile Europe that chooses to side with the oppressors to the detriment of innocent peoples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I trust the honourable Members have noticed the same strong focus on fundamental human rights and universal values in the recent Commission communication and in the Council conclusions on China. This reflects the fact that it is and will remain an important priority for the European Union with regard to our overall relations with that country.</p>
<p class="contents">We share the concern expressed in the joint resolution regarding the human rights situation in Tibet and, in particular, the preservation of the cultural, religious and linguistic identity of the Tibetan people. This issue has been regularly addressed by the European Union in the framework of bilateral dialogue on human rights, as well as at the highest political level, such as our bilateral summits and senior officials’ meetings. Former European Parliament President, Mr Borrell, also raised the matter when he officially visited China last year.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the recent shooting mentioned by Mr Czarnecki, I would like to inform you that this matter was formally taken up by the European Union during the last session of the EU-China Dialogue on human rights held in Beijing in October 2006 and via the subsequent follow-up démarche in December 2006. On both occasions, the EU urged the Chinese authorities to undertake a thorough investigation of this incident and refuted the Chinese claim that the shooting had been done in self-defence. We will follow this serious matter closely. I agree with Mr Matsakis that bloodshed leads nowhere.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission has regularly kept this Chamber informed regarding its overall policy vis-à-vis Tibet and will continue to do so. As Commissioner Fischer Boel underlined in this Chamber in October 2006, the EU has consistently taken the view that establishing a direct dialogue between the Dalai Lama and the Chinese authorities is the only realistic way to find a peaceful and lasting solution to the question of Tibet, which will hopefully lead to the recognition of a genuine autonomy of the Tibetan region. We have therefore followed very closely and welcomed the five rounds of talks which have taken place up to now between the Special Envoys of the Dalai Lama and the Chinese Government. In this respect, EU officials have regular contacts with the two Special Envoys, the last being in November 2006. Even in this Chamber there are differing opinions on the question of the appointment of a special EU envoy. We have our doubts about the value of such an appointment, because such an envoy would probably be prevented from having a real impact on the ground or from playing a significant role in this dialogue. We need the two sides to continue and deepen the dialogue.</p>
<p class="contents">We agree with the honourable Members that this dialogue should be regular and substantive, and that the respective parties should refrain from taking any step that would compromise the establishment of a climate of confidence. We take note that the Tibetan side is ready for a rapid resumption of the dialogue and hope that the Chinese side is willing to do the same. The European Union will spare no efforts in stressing the importance of this dialogue to both parties on all possible occasions.</p>
<p class="contents">I also want to express my gratitude for your attention and focus on this matter and your support, especially now via this resolution, because such support is helpful in the process. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that it is sound, impartial and relevant. Constructive solutions need to be found for this age-old issue of Tibet.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion for a resolution is geared towards finding a solution to the Tibet question which is compatible with China’s right to self-determination and which respects the rights of the people of Tibet, and this, I think, is the right approach. We need a constructive, peaceful process that recognises that Tibetan nationals have a right to their own culture and religion. As citizens of Europe and of the world, we have to ensure that people’s fundamental rights can be implemented around the world. In this respect it is to be hoped that people’s cultural and religious rights will not be restricted in Tibet either. We would hope that proper dialogue can be established between Tibet and China, leading to a solution that is satisfactory to both sides.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that we will find practical solutions which also show respect for China’s regional inviolability but which at the same time fulfil the wishes of the Tibetan people. I do not know if this is too much to hope for, but we in the European Union must work hard to establish such a peaceful coexistence. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The primary reason is the occupation of Iraq by troops from the US, the UK and other EU Member States, and, above all, the nature of that occupation. If you pursue a policy of occupation of this nature, you should not be surprised when it generates refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Despite Germany's restrictive asylum policy, people from Iraq now form the largest group of asylum-seekers in that country. According to figures from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are 1.7 million refugees within Iraq and a further 2 million in neighbouring countries. These people are fleeing because Iraq is in a state of war. The Bloomberg School of Public Health and the Johns Hopkins University have presented a study, published in the <span class="italic">New York Times</span> and the <span class="italic">Washington Post</span>, which estimated the number of Iraqis over and above the normal mortality rate who died as a result of the invasion and its consequences between March 2003 and July 2006 to be 650 000. Of these, the estimates count 600 000 people who have died as a direct result of violence and 50 000 who have died as a result of disease and other causes. The study goes on to say that, after the end of the invasion, 31% of the victims were believed to have been killed by coalition troops or air raids. According to the Johns Hopkins University, the risk of dying a violent death is 58 times higher than before the invasion.</p>
<p class="contents">What I want to say to this House is that these figures show that the occupation of Iraq is wrong and must finally be brought to an end. The collective support of this war by a number of EU Member States, including Germany, must cease. If that happened, there would not, in fact, be as many people who have to flee as there are at present, as has been quite properly stated in the resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I cannot agree with the point made by the previous speaker, which was not discussed when we framed this report. May I say that what we can do in the European Commission, the European Council and the European Parliament is something different.</p>
<p class="contents">There are huge numbers of Iraqi refugees in Jordan, in Syria and in other neighbouring states, yet in almost every one of those countries these refugees are not allowed to work. Their children are prevented from going to school. Their parents and children are not allowed access to healthcare. They are in a desperate plight and there is no state support for them, as there would be were they in European Union Member States as refugees.</p>
<p class="contents">Inside the country there are huge numbers of IDPs – internally displaced people – equally without work, without food, far from their homes. They have been displaced mainly through religious and ethnic cleansing, one of the most miserable of wars to fight internally, as we know so well from our past history in Europe. The Shia are fleeing the Sunni, the Sunni are fleeing the Shia and many others are fleeing because of the various different insurgencies that are going on.</p>
<p class="contents">I would suggest, therefore, that the European Commission, which has worked mightily on this problem, should declare Iraq an emergency. I would ask the Council of Ministers, which has also worked incredibly hard with the Government of Iraq, to discuss this with the Commission and with other G8 donors, for example.</p>
<p class="contents">Iraq has in a sense been put on one side. People have been unclear as to what to do, but today, now, the Iraqi people are back in the sort of crisis they were in under the prolonged dictatorship of Saddam Hussein, under whom many more fled and under whom many more were killed. But here we are. They need our help.</p>
<p class="contents">I strongly request that the Commission and the Council of Ministers declare Iraq to be in an emergency state, to mobilise donor funding and spend it accordingly: housing inside, aid outside. There is a lot that we can do, but we have to look at the situation differently. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It also demonstrates the double standards of our own Member State governments, particularly, I am afraid, my own in London, rather than Edinburgh, where I would rather it were.</p>
<p class="contents">Chancellor Gordon Brown was asked how much funding was to be allocated to the military action and his answer was ‘as much as it takes’. I am afraid the financial allocation to the humanitarian support measures is shameful.</p>
<p class="contents">As we have heard, the United Nations estimates that 1.8 million people have been forcibly displaced within Iraq and 2 million have fled that unhappy country. That is more than the population of a number of our Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">Prime Minister Blair worries about international terrorism – he talks about it often enough. Well he might! The direct result of his policies has created the best possible recruiting ground al-Qa’ida could ever have asked for.</p>
<p class="contents">So, what to do? As we, of course, go through airport security this evening flying home from this place, let us think that that is Prime Minister Blair’s legacy to Europe and to global politics. We, as we have heard, can do better: by sticking to our principles and by digging deep into our budgets.</p>
<p class="contents">The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Red Cross efforts are severely underfunded. The countries neighbouring Iraq are in desperate straits and in dire need of support. This motion has a number of points in it which I commend to the House.</p>
<p class="contents">We did not create this disaster, but we are in a position to ameliorate its effects. By doing so, I hope we can lead by example where so many of our Member State governments have so comprehensively failed. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I should like to thank the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, Mr António Guterres, for drawing attention to this disaster, which took place on 7 February.</p>
<p class="contents">I should also like to give a special word of commendation to the Swedish authorities for their exceptional European-level response to the human disaster. I should particularly like to commend the Egyptian authorities, which is the non-bordering country that has done by far the most to welcome these refugees, and I should like to make a heartfelt plea to the Egyptian authorities not to prevent these refugees from arriving or to suspend the conditions for hosting them when they arrive.</p>
<p class="contents">Most of all, however, I wish to call on the Commission and the Council – as Mr Posselt, who is here today, so aptly reminded us – to open their eyes, to go to Iraq and to see what is happening there. A disaster of this nature would never be possible unless it were organised from somewhere, as was the case previously in Rwanda and in the Balkans. We can no longer turn a blind eye; we must go to Iraq and understand what is happening. In this connection, I should like to say that I am proud that I was there recently. I have drawn up a report and invite all my fellow Members to have a look at it on the Internet. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Mr Casaca has just recalled the political context of the invasion of Iraq and its consequences. He may well be right.</p>
<p class="contents">I would prefer to focus on issues that may not be as important for journalists or for politicians like ourselves, but which are probably far more important for those who are currently going through hard times in Iraq, namely the refugees. In my view, the underlying reasons for events in the world of politics are of secondary importance. What is really important is what we can actually do. I am firmly convinced that we are currently being perceived as helpless by the rest of the world. I am also firmly convinced that the European Union is not in a position to provide real help to these people. This is even truer of the United States, and is really tragic.</p>
<p class="contents">There seem to be two aspects to the situation in Iraq. There are the victims of attacks, in the form of the hundreds and thousands of people we see on our television screens. They make up the news we are bombarded with. We hear very little, however, about the other aspect of the situation in Iraq, namely the tens of thousands of refugees. The European Union must certainly not appear helpless in this regard, and I agree with the previous speakers who referred to initiatives by the Scandinavian countries and to Egypt’s role. All that is true.</p>
<p class="contents">We must make a clear and determined statement to the effect that we are interested not only in that first aspect, namely the victims of the attacks we see on television. We must let it be known that, as Europeans, as European politicians, we are equally concerned about refugees. The refugee problem is probably one of the greatest embarrassments for those who started this war and for those who are pursuing it, even if they are acting with the best of intentions. A reaction is therefore necessary, and that is what the European Parliament is currently engaged in. I am grateful for the wise words contributed by other speakers today. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The situation has reached a state of civil war. The Christian minority in particular have become a scapegoat, and many Christians have been killed. Iraqi security forces have been unable to protect Christians, no matter what the Government’s attitude is.</p>
<p class="contents">For example, Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon have taken it upon themselves to place refugees temporarily. In these countries, the United Nations refugee agency has not been able to confer refugee status on incoming Iraqis during the current conflict because the situation does not meet the criteria of the Geneva Convention. The present Government in Iraq is not persecuting Christians, but the problem is that sects inside the country are, and the Government cannot do anything about it.</p>
<p class="contents">International agreements therefore do not grant refugee status to Iraqi Christians, although there is no doubt that they are in need of temporary protection. To protect the asylum seekers, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees has not made a negative decision with regard to them either, since otherwise the host country could return them to Iraq, a situation which the UNHCR wants to avoid. Accordingly, it is vitally important that the international community responds to the agency’s appeal for more international support. To aid the refugees, international assistance is required so that Iraq’s neighbouring countries, which are struggling with huge numbers of refugees, will not close their borders to Iraqis. The latest news that the United States of America is accepting more refugees is a step in the right direction, and is vital, because earlier the United States had been shirking its responsibilities in this area. We need more news like this. Of the EU countries, Sweden deserves special mention.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iraqi refugee situation is absolutely desperate. There is a shortage of everything: food, medicines, health care and fuel. I heard of actual examples of this when the human rights organisation I head met a group of Iraqi Christian refugees in Turkey last autumn.</p>
<p class="contents">Crucial, however, to the assistance of Iraqis is to establish comprehensive reforms to promote justice and the law throughout Iraq. Similarly, the Iraqi Government must do all it can to bring those guilty of crimes and breaches of human rights to justice. This is essential if the unrest and violence against minorities is to cease. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We must bear in mind that the Christian communities in today’s Iraq are probably some of the most ancient in the world. They have survived for 1 300 years as a minority in a Muslim-dominated part of the world, something for which those Muslims also deserve credit, yet today, in a time of massive Western presence in Iraq, they are under threat. This has to do with the fact that Iraq was put together as an artificial state after the First World War, that that state is now on the point of breaking up and that its constituent parts are attempting to make themselves homogenous units through a process of nationalistic self-discovery which, of course, poses a particular threat to the minorities.</p>
<p class="contents">There is one laudable exception, and that is the Kurdish sector. This is something worth highlighting. I do, however, call on Shias and Sunnis to follow in the great tolerant tradition of their forefathers and once again afford the Christian communities in Iraq the protection that they have enjoyed in that part of the world for over a thousand years. I call, above all, on the Commission to go into bat strongly for the rights of Christians, because who else will do this if we do not? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">To all intents and purposes this is a humanitarian catastrophe almost without precedent, and for this reason the opportunity offered by the Geneva Conference on 17 April 2007 should not be wasted: the European Union must prepare itself and arrive in force, with a political presence at the highest levels, having already decided on an appropriate amount of funds to put on the table. If this is not done, we risk total failure. This is a point on which we all need to be united, regardless of the political reasons for the conflict: thus the greatest possible unity is needed to resolve an issue which is liable to explode in our faces, with disastrous consequences.</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to its causes, I believe that perhaps – obviously this is not the subject of our resolution; I am just mentioning it to the representatives of the Council and the Commission – it would be useful to take into consideration the possibility, faced with the daily carnage in Iraq, of referring the matter to the International Criminal Court, since these are crimes against humanity, committed systematically and on a daily basis.

Iraq’s Christian communities are amongst the world’s most ancient, speaking Aramaic, the language of Christ. They suffered terribly during the 1915 Armenian genocide, and then again under the Iraqi Hashemite monarchy for cooperating with the British during the First World War. Then they suffered again during Saddam Hussein’s days when he had the war with the Kurds. Today there are only about 6 000 to 8 000 who remain, mainly living in the Nineveh Plain.</p>
<p class="contents">As many as 60 000 Assyrian Christians, or perhaps even more, have fled since the beginning of the insurgency that followed the US-led invasion in 2003. Their exodus was accelerated in August 2004 after the start of the terrorist bombing campaign against Christian churches by Islamists, who accused them of collaborating with the allies solely by virtue of their practising the Christian faith.</p>
<p class="contents">Last April the European Parliament voted for the Assyrians to be allowed to establish, on the basis of Section 5 of the Iraqi Constitution, a federal region where they can practise their own unique way of life, free and safe from outside interference. I call again on this House, on the Commission and on the Human Rights Special Observer from the German Presidency, for this solution to be considered as a possibility. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We do not get enough information though about another tragedy – the painful fate of becoming a refugee has affected 4 million Iraqis. Almost one in six of the inhabitants of that country has been forced to leave his or her home, the number of refugees is increasing, and their situation is terrible. The United Nations Organisation is trying to help, but unsuccessfully, because the international community has still not grasped the seriousness of the situation. The initiative of Sweden, which has agreed to grant refugee status to 9 000 Iraqis, is to be commended. Not many EU countries so far, especially the new ones, have had the resolve to follow this example. However, particular responsibility falls on the United States, which, willy-nilly, created the current situation, in which Iraq is wading ever deeper into the quagmire of a nation beset by divisive internal and external conflicts.</p>

The illegal military invasion and occupation of Iraq undertaken in 2003 by Mr Bush and his British bulldog, Mr Blair, have brought an unprecedented calamity to the people of Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The Bush-Blair duo has succeeded in accomplishing in the space of three years what the likes of Saddam Hussein did not succeed in doing for thirty years, i.e. to bring the country completely to its knees, with hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians killed, with utter lawlessness, with comprehensive destruction of the country’s infrastructure and with millions of internal and external refugees. The USA and Britain could together spend over one thousand billion dollars a year supporting their war machines in Iraq, which largely caused the problem in the first place, but now expect the international community to deal with the enormous humanitarian problem of the Iraq refugees. Instead of the USA and Britain taking care of the Iraqi refugees and all the necessary costs involved, they expect neighbouring and European countries to do so. Fair enough: we must not deviate from the rule that those who cause a catastrophe very seldom pay for it. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am delighted the German Ombudsman is with us today.</p>
<p class="contents">According to UN data, almost two million people have left Iraq in recent years because of the danger to their lives, the chaos and the difficult economic conditions. We are witnessing a major tragedy of refugees fleeing from Iraq to neighbouring countries. There are a million of them in Syria, some 750 000 in Jordan, over 100 000 in Egypt, 40 000 in Lebanon and many more scattered throughout other countries. Those Palestinians inside Iraq are in a particularly difficult position. In its statement on 2 February 2007, Human Rights Watch called on Syria to immediately open its borders to the Palestinians who are currently in danger in Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">The UN is calling for a contribution of USD 60 million to a fund to help refugees from Iraq. The world cannot remain indifferent to their fate. Today’s decision by the United States to grant asylum in the United States to 7 000 Iraqis next year is a step in the right direction, as is the decision by the United States to contribute USD 18 million to the programme to assist refugees from Iraq.</p>
<p class="contents">These are still only drops in the ocean of need, however. The European Union must play a leading role in the forthcoming conference to be held in Geneva on 17 April 2007. It must provide financial support to alleviate the plight of the refugees and help resolve this crisis. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There was a strong focus on the eminent need for solidarity with the people in great need. The Commission is also extremely concerned about the humanitarian situation in Iraq and the scale of human suffering caused by the ongoing violence in that country, the high level of displacement inside and outside Iraq and the impact this is having on the whole region.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the past few months the Commission has kept monitoring the situation, keeping in close contact with other key international players, notably with the Red Cross and the United Nations.</p>
<p class="contents">As you have mentioned, we have the same figures from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees: 1.8 million people are now internally displaced and 2 million Iraqis have already fled to neighbouring countries. As Mr Smith said, that is nearly 4 million people.</p>
<p class="contents">However, an exact assessment of the needs inside Iraq has so far been made impossible by the difficulties of gaining access to the affected populations as a result of the security situation.</p>
<p class="contents">The conference the United Nations is holding in Geneva in April, which has also been mentioned here, is expected to provide more clarity regarding the situation of internal and external displacements, the impact and the needs. The Commission will take an active part in that Conference. I am certain that Mr Cappato expressed an important invitation be united there with the Council and the Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">In the meantime, based on the information received from partner international humanitarian agencies, the Commission, through its Directorate-General for Humanitarian Aid (ECHO), has decided to allocate EUR 10.2 million for humanitarian aid to the victims of the Iraqi crisis.</p>
<p class="contents">As announced this morning by my colleague Mr Michel, an initial funding package of EUR 6.2 million, focusing on the most vulnerable groups, will be proposed for meeting the humanitarian needs of refugees who have fled to countries such as Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. The aid will consist of basic healthcare and education, as well as targeted distributions of food and essential household items. Protection activities are also envisaged, in particular support for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ refugee registration system, which is important in identifying the most vulnerable groups and assessing their specific needs.</p>
<p class="contents">Another initial funding package of EUR 4 million is in the process of being drawn up for people suffering inside Iraq, based on a careful assessment of priority needs and aid delivery arrangements in what is a highly volatile security environment, as you can imagine.</p>
<p class="contents">Humanitarian aid will be provided impartially and without discrimination, with a focus on those most at risk. The Commission will consider further funding decisions when new needs emerge or when access to groups requiring help, and who are currently out of reach, becomes possible.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also continue monitoring the situation closely and to raise specific matters through its regular discussions with third countries and the Government of Iraq, including the Ministry of Displacement and Migration.</p>
<p class="contents">If the situation deteriorates further in the coming months, the Commission will examine the situation in the light of the criteria of the Temporary Protection Directive, in order to decide whether to submit to the Council a request to activate the temporary protection mechanism for the Iraqi asylum seekers. This may offer them immediate protection while, at the same time, providing financial support for their actual reception as well as making arrangements for an eventual redistribution of asylum seekers amongst Member States.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission will also explore, in close cooperation with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the possibility for a coordinated effort by EU Member States to resettle refugees from the region. Such a resettlement effort could target particularly vulnerable categories of people, such as women-at-risk and unaccompanied minors.</p>

In the 11 other colonially governed areas, the elite chose, often disregarding the will of their own people, to perpetuate close administrative, military and economic ties with France. Guinea, on the other hand, followed the example of the former British colony Ghana, which had gained independence one year earlier, and which wanted to develop an African model of socialism with strong participation of the own population. The leaders Sekou Touré and Kwame Nkrumah inspired many Africans in their battle for a better future, in which colonialism and poverty were set to be replaced by equality and development. Unfortunately, a military <span class="italic">coup</span> in both countries stopped this development in its tracks. In Guinea, Conté has wielded dictatorial power since 1984. Most parties did not take part in the elections that were organised under his control, and the official opposition that was represented in parliament was forced to leave it. The trade union confederations CNTG and USTG are now the main force in the fight for democracy. The presidential security force, led by the dictator’s son, responded to their protest rally on 22 January by killing 59 people and wounding 150 others. The dictator increasingly treats the country as his own private property. Like many other countries that are run by dictators, Guinea is also becoming the victim of the fight over natural resources among factions that want to get their hands on the revenues from them. In this case, the resources in question are gold, iron and bauxite. This resolution stands up for the demands of the democratic opposition, and it enjoys my group’s support. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The time has come for the Union to take action, as the situation in Guinea is sliding downhill.</p>
<p class="contents">Guinea has for too long been deliberately kept in a state of underdevelopment by the dictatorial regime and is becoming mired in a tragic deadlock for lack of transparency and democracy. The people of Guinea have had enough of poverty, destitution and social injustice; they have not enjoyed the benefits of Guinea’s riches – the country has an abundance of natural resources – which are monopolised and mismanaged by the President and his cronies, who are as guilty as he is. President Conté, who has been in power since 1984, is ill, and is clinging to life as he is clinging to power. If he survives, no one will begrudge him his health. If, on the other hand, he remains in power and re-establishes a state of emergency. We will neither understand nor accept this.</p>
<p class="contents">After decades of undiluted power, one has no choice but to condemn such an attitude when wisdom, or a modicum of compassion for his people, would surely have led the President to prepare for the smooth transfer of power to his successor and for the transition to a genuinely democratic regime. Instead of that, a state of siege has been declared, the right to assembly and freedom of movement have been curtailed, and the military have violently broken up peaceful demonstrations and killed people. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p class="contents">We have no choice but to condemn this brutality, this lack of respect for the most basic human rights of the people of Guinea and the shameful behaviour of a leader who is at the end of his reign but whose capacity for causing suffering is sadly not at an end. We must demand that a committee of inquiry be set up to look into the events in Guinea in order to ascertain the full extent of the repression and the level of the hierarchy at which decisions have been taken and by whom.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, will the EU demand political dialogue, as laid down in Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement? We must keep a very close eye on the situation, because, if it were to continue to worsen, not only would the people of Guinea suffer but so too could the whole of that region of Africa, as the deepening internal conflict would spread to neighbouring countries. The past is sadly all too full of such examples. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It first became known to Europeans during the Portuguese discoveries that started the slave trade in the 15th century.</p>
<p class="contents">In 1890, present-day Guinea was created as a French colony and remained so until 1958. From 1958 until 1984 the country was governed by a dictator, Ahmed Sékou Touré, who was supported by the Soviet Union. Following Touré’s death in 1984, a new totalitarian regime took over, headed by another dictator, Lansana Conté, who some claim was supported largely by the West. Conté’s rule has certainly been better than Touré’s, but is still very far from being democratic. The heavy-handed approach to political opponents and the events in February which led to the killing of 23 demonstrators is proof of that. Guinea represents a country used and sometimes abused by Europe in the past and is now struggling to survive in extreme poverty and political instability.</p>
<p class="contents">Guinea’s mineral wealth makes it, potentially at least, one of Africa’s richest countries. We, as Europeans, have a duty to assist its people – honestly and effectively this time – in finding and following the road to true democracy, freedom, justice and prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Guinea is in complete decline. Despite its status as the leading exporter of bauxite and despite its deposits of gold, diamonds and iron, its people are among the poorest in the world. Its wealth is consumed by corruption, and bad governance does the rest. Repression beats down on a people who no longer accept it. President Conté’s only response to the January strikes was to have the crowd fired on, to imprison the trade unionists, then, having pretended to negotiate on 27 January, to go back on his commitment to appoint a consensus prime minister and to declare a state of emergency. There have now been more than one hundred deaths, and the massacre goes on.</p>
<p class="contents">Europe cannot remain silent and do nothing. We cannot wait for Guinea to descend into chaos with unforeseeable consequences for the region. Europe has a responsibility to fulfil.</p>
<p class="contents">We call on the Commission to implement the provisions of Article 96 of the Cotonou Agreement, applicable in the event of violation of human rights and democratic principles. We must now support the people of Guinea and demand that the authorities end the massacres immediately, release those arrested during the demonstrations, restore civil liberties, lift the state of siege, open negotiations with the trade unions and civil society, and, in cooperation with the opposition parties, appoint a consensus prime minister and government.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, I believe that the European Union must call for elections to be convened under international supervision, with missions sent by the European Union and the United Nations. That is what is currently being done in Mauritania, involving our fellow Member, Mrs Isler Béguin, to whom I pay tribute in this House, and it was what was done in the Democratic Republic of Congo, with results that have been extremely effective and significant.</p>
<p class="contents">Finally, we must indeed support the proposal for an independent committee of inquiry, led by the United Nations, into the violence of recent months. After twenty-three years of dictatorship, enough is enough; the European people must stand alongside the people of Guinea in their fight for freedom and dignity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The fact that, despite this, the country is languishing in miserable poverty is a result of the terrible mismanagement, the dictatorship and the abysmal administration by the state that have obtained there for decades and I am most grateful to Mr Matsakis for having pointed out that Sékou Touré, to whom Mr Meijer referred, was one of worst dictators ever to rule over it.</p>
<p class="contents">Today too, unfortunately, the prevailing state of affairs is anything but acceptable, for which reason we must call on the current transitional president – for he cannot be any more than this – to use the short period that remains to him to bring about an ordered transition to democracy and the rule of law. He can only do this, however, if he does not name a puppet as prime minister, as he now has, but only if he truly commits to the demands of the trade unions and the democracy movement and constitutes a broad-based transitional government, including the forces of opposition, which then does nothing other than set about creating public order and preparing free elections so that the past terror and dictatorship can finally give place to democracy and prosperity. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A large proportion of its people live in abject poverty. This was the reason for the strikes and demonstrations that took place in 2005 and also at the start of this year, protesting against the corrupt rule of Lasana Conté who has been in power for 23 years.</p>
<p class="contents">The strikes are an expression of discontent regarding inflation, unemployment, energy and water shortages and the high price of basic goods. In recent times, the strikes have also led to the interruption of the export of aluminium ore, which is Guinea’s most precious asset. Tremendous losses were incurred, reaching a level of USD one million a day. The leaders of the January strike and the trade unions did suspend the protest, however, following the signing of an agreement demanding a change of Prime Minister. The promises contained in the agreement between the trade unions, the Parliament of Guinea and its Supreme Court were not kept, and once again a member of the ruling party was appointed Prime Minister. This does not bode well in terms of improving the situation, as demanded by the protestors.</p>
<p class="contents">Events in Guinea are similar to those that took place in my home country some time ago. In Guinea, the current regime is also firing on fellow citizens fighting for change, better living conditions and respect for fundamental human rights. We demand respect for the principles of democracy and reforms in a country whose inhabitants wish to live in dignity, supported by their own natural wealth which is currently being exploited by rich companies and siphoned off by corruption. Thousands of Guineans are dying of hunger and poverty. Over a hundred were killed during the demonstration. These are the victims of a fledgling democracy and of the struggle for human rights. They are also a stain on the consciences of those who value aluminium ore, bauxite, gold and diamonds more than human lives. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

However, together we can help to bring more hope to Guinea.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission is fully aware of the situation in that country. In a press release of 22 January, the European Commission condemned the violent interventions by the security forces and called for restraint and civic responsibility during these demonstrations. Commissioner Michel regretted the loss of human lives and encouraged the different stakeholders to pursue a constructive dialogue in order to implement the necessary political reforms important for that country.</p>
<p class="contents">The German Presidency, on behalf of the Union, issued a declaration on 9 February regretting the loss of life during the demonstrations and asking the Government of Guinea for an explanation of the circumstances of those deaths and of the judicial steps being taken against those responsible.</p>
<p class="contents">The inquiry commission appointed in Guinea is led by public prosecutors, but victims and relatives are invited to submit their cases either to the courts, which have limited means, or to the police, an institution heavily involved in the repression. Given this situation, the Guinean Bar has refused to participate in the inquiry commission and has called for an international commission instead. The Bar also wishes to present a case to the International Criminal Court.</p>
<p class="contents">The Commission’s delegation in Conakry and Member States’ embassies have repeatedly stressed to the Government of Guinea the need to carry out a full inquiry into the events. This was also stressed by Commissioner Michel to Foreign Minister Condé. The delegation and other diplomats have also stressed to the new Prime Minister that the behaviour of security forces observed during the previous strike should simply stop.</p>
<p class="contents">The ninth European Development Fund cooperation strategy with Guinea, signed on 21 December 2006, includes governance as a focal factor, as a priority. Actions foreseen are aimed at promoting effectiveness and transparency in public management, reinforcing the rule of law and promoting a democratic society.</p>
<p class="contents">A reinforced political dialogue with the country is ongoing as a follow-up to the Article 96 (Cotonou Agreement) consultations, which ended in April 2005. The Commission has stressed to the Guinean authorities that the new situation would be taken into account in this context.</p>

<p>(DE) The following answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding on neither the Council nor its members, was presented in a non-oral form at the Council’s question time in the European Parliament’s plenary sitting in February 2007 in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 28 November 2006 the Council reached political agreement on the proposal for a directive on the exemption from valued added tax and excise duty of goods imported by persons travelling from third countries.</p>
<p>The Council decided to raise the current 175-euro monetary threshold, which was laid down in 1994, to 300 euros for people travelling over land, including on inland waterways, and 430 euros for air and sea passengers. In the view of the Council, it was appropriate to adjust the threshold in line with the evolution of monetary values. As a result of the planned removal of the specific maximum quantities for perfume, coffee and tea, these items will also fall beneath the threshold in future. If the threshold were not raised, travellers would be able to carry fewer duty-free items than before.</p>
<p>The amendment to the directive also gives the Member States greater flexibility and reduces the administrative burden involved in routine controls and, especially, calculating charges in the case of small quantities. In the interests of travellers, goods of relatively low value need no longer be declared.</p>
<p>As far as tobacco products and alcoholic drinks are concerned, I should point out that these are subject to quantitative restrictions and are thus unaffected by the increase in the threshold. On the contrary, in the interests of supporting their health policies, Member States are to apply lower maximum quantities for imports of tobacco products.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1074"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>In essence, the honourable Member’s question relates to two points, namely what he terms the ‘constitutional crisis’ and enlargement.</p>
<p>Further to the first point, the honourable Member is referred to the statement by the Heads of State and Government, on the occasion of their meeting in December 2006, to the effect that the Union’s approach is twin-track, in that it makes use of the best possible options afforded by the Treaties currently in force in order to achieve concrete objectives, while at the same time working to prepare the way for the continuation of the reform process. As announced in December, the Finnish Presidency handed over the outcomes of its consultations with the Member States on the constitutional treaty to the German Presidency as part of its preparations for the report to be presented in the first six months of 2007. The intention is that the report should highlight possible future developments. It will also serve as a basis for further decisions as to how the process of reforming the EU should be planned.</p>
<p>I can answer with greater brevity the second point of the honourable Member’s question, relating to enlargement. Firstly, in reaching, in December, their renewed consensus on enlargement, the Heads of State and Government stressed that the EU would honour the promises made to the countries already in the enlargement process. Secondly – and this is no less important – they stated that, as the enlargement of the European Union progresses, European integration can be successful only if the EU institutions continue to function efficiently and if EU policy continues to develop and be funded in a sustainable manner.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1079"></a>

<p>Royal Decree 1316/2001 regulates the discounts given to residents of the autonomous communities of the Canaries and the Balearic Islands on standard fares in air and sea transport (43% discount on the price of tickets, rising to 50% in 2007). This measure was introduced to offset the disadvantages associated with islands.</p>
<p>The regional government of the Balearics is seeking to extend the right to claim this discount to immigrants resident in the Balearics. It is basing its action on the principle of 'equal obligations - equal rights', since immigrants residing in the islands are obliged to contribute to the public purse but do not enjoy the right to benefit from discounted fares on scheduled air and sea transport services. Achieving a genuine integration policy entails offering non-Community residents the same incentives as those granted to national or Community residents. This will make it possible for these residents to be effectively and genuinely integrated, in a context of solidarity and equality.</p>
<p>Does the Council believe that the European institutions should be involved in this issue, since it relates to integration policy seen from the point of view of human rights, democracy and the rule of law? Could the Council oblige or advise the Spanish Government to amend the above decree so as to extend equal rights to all residents, regardless of whether they are nationals of Member States or of non-Community countries?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

On average only 28% of people with MS have access to vital disease-modifying drugs, despite there being a great amount of evidence showing that high standards of treatment have a positive affect on the lives of people with MS and ultimately on the social security budgets of the Member States. The EP has called for a code of good practice on the rights and quality of life of people with MS, which would look at crucial issues around employment and job retention, a joint research agenda and meaningful participation of people with MS themselves.

<p>The Council has reached political agreement on the Second Programme of Community Action in the Field of Public Health, and the presidency hopes to reach agreement with the European Parliament at second reading. The programme provides for the possibility of furthering an exchange of knowledge and best practice, collection and analysis of health-related data, and distribution of information on health issues.</p>
<p>In addition, the Seventh Research Framework Programme opens up possibilities for health research in the field of neurodegenerative diseases.</p>
<p>The Commission has not so far presented a specific proposal on multiple sclerosis and the presidency has planned no special activities of the Council on this subject.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1087"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>On 21 December 2006, the Council adopted Regulation 1933/2006/EC temporarily withdrawing access to the generalised tariff preferences from the Republic of Belarus<a href="#defann_6_1" name="refann_6_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. It needs to be emphasised, however, that this measure is not conceived as a sanction, but rather as a suspension of preferences resulting from Belarus’ failure to comply with international labour standards, particularly the right to freedom of association.</p>
<p>The Council is aware of the potential economic consequences that might result, for certain Member States, from the withdrawal of access to the generalised tariff preferences and from the consequent return to the generally applicable tariffs. It has to be said, however, that such economic consequences would be limited, since most goods imported into the EU from Belarus have not hitherto enjoyed preferences under the generalised scheme. What is also at issue is the maintenance of the European Union’s credibility, of coherence in the application of its decisions and the upholding of its core values.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of access to the generalised tariff preferences does not, however, enter into effect immediately, but rather only six months following the decision being taken, and even then only if it has not become evident before that date that Belarus has remedied the deficits as found and a decision has therefore been taken that the conditions resulting in this Regulation no longer apply. This gives the authorities in Belarus a further opportunity to comply with the relevant international standards. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) will be continuing its examination of this matter at the 298<span class="sup">th</span> sitting of its Governing Body in March 2007 and at the 96<span class="sup">th</span> International Labour Conference in June 2007, and will be subjecting to particular scrutiny the latest changes to the law submitted by the Belarus Government. The Commission has undertaken to report to the Council on current developments in Belarus following the ILO governing body meeting in Geneva in March 2007.</p>
<p>As for the last part of the question, the withdrawal of the generalised tariff preferences has had no effect on Russia’s determination to increase gas prices for Belarus, and the Council has no evidence of any attempt on Russia’s part to depict the EU’s policy as hostile.</p>
<p>There is no contradiction between the withdrawal of access to the generalised tariff preferences and the non-paper ‘What the European Union could bring to Belarus’, according to which the EU is unable to normalise and deepen its relations with Belarus for as long as the authorities there continue to offend against democratic values and violate the fundamental rights of the country’s people.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally at Council Question Time at the European Parliament's February 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The negotiations on the EU-US air transport agreement were wound up in November 2005. The EU subsequently waited for more than a year for the outcome of the US Government’s internal procedures as a result of which rules were to be drawn up on foreign holdings in US carriers.</p>
<p>At its meeting of 12 December 2006, however, the Council was informed that the US Department of Transportation had withdrawn the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (NPRM) concerning extended scope for holdings in US carriers, which had been issued as long ago as November 2005. The Council expressed deep disappointment and its regret at that decision, and reaffirmed its commitment to the goal of securing a historic, first-stage EU-US comprehensive air transport agreement that would increase legal certainty and replace the existing bilateral agreements. To that end, and further to the proposal of the US, the Council requested the Commission to enter into urgent consultations with the US as soon as possible in order to seek elements that could be used to restore a proper balance of interests.</p>
<p>EU-US relations in this area are addressed only in the context of the EU-US air transport agreement referred to, and the possibility of concluding bilateral air transport agreements between EU Member States and the US is not being considered by the parties involved.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2006-1090"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The honourable Member points out that, in the United States, more stringent NOx emission values currently apply than is the case in the European Union. Because of differences in the test procedures, however, the limit values are not directly comparable.</p>
<p>The ‘Euro 5’ and ‘Euro 6’ limit values recently adopted accomplish a drastic reduction in NOx emission in Europe. Compliance with the requirements in Europe – as also in the USA – is achieved by enforcing the removal of the most particulates possible from the exhausts of diesel private motor vehicles.</p>
<p>It is worthy of note that there has been, to date, only a small market for private diesel motor vehicles in the USA, and so the technology required to achieve the American limit value was made available only for a few diesel cars at the top of the medium range. Private motor cars of all classes equipped with the most modern diesel engines occupy a markedly larger segment of the European market than they do in the United States, and one of the effects of this is a reduction in the amount of CO2 emitted by vehicles in the EU. The problem of CO2 emissions will be addressed in the forthcoming Commission communication on the amendment of the Community’s strategy for reducing the emission of CO2 from motor vehicles, to which the Council will be giving close attention.</p>
<p>The EU is engaged in putting the case for further harmonisation of the requirements applicable to motor vehicles to the UN Economic Commission for Europe, which is based in Geneva.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0003"></a>

<p>The Council wishes to assure the honourable Member that security of supply represents one of the most important priorities of the Community’s energy policy, as is evident from the many approaches being employed, in accordance with this policy, in order to make the Community’s supplies more secure, including, among other examples, the diversification of sources of supply and transport routes, the diversification of energy sources, greater energy efficiency, an external energy policy, the optimisation of the functioning of the internal market in energy and measures aimed as promoting transparency.</p>
<p>The objective of guaranteeing the security of the Community’s supplies is also a key characteristic of the Community’s dealings with Russia concerning energy. The Council is persuaded that the Community’s interest in secure supplies is best served by a mutually beneficial and stable energy relationship with Russia – a relationship that is transparent and must function in a reliable manner.</p>
<p>The European Council of 23/24 March 2006 stated that improvement of security of supply involved ensuring common operational approaches to address crisis situations in a spirit of solidarity, taking subsidiarity into account. It ought also to be noted that the 2006 statement on security of supply by the G8 explicitly endorsed the principles of the energy charter.</p>
<p>The Council can assure the honourable Member that no effort was spared or is being spared to find a compromise as regards the incorporation of relevant references to the Energy Charter Treaty into the negotiation guidelines.</p>

<p>All operators of nuclear power stations are required to comply with the Community and national safety regulations. The national authorities to which safety and protection against radiation are entrusted are responsible for ensuring that the necessary checks are carried out.

<p>The Council wishes to thank the Honourable Member for his interest in this important topic. Since 2005, the EU has made considerable progress in stepping up its contingency planning for a possible flu pandemic.</p>
<p>Throughout Europe, contingency planning for a pandemic is currently being tackled with great political commitment. All Member States now have national contingency plans for flu, which have now progressed beyond the drafting stage to the implementation stage. At EU level, guidelines are also available for contingency planning for a flu pandemic (e.g. the Commission communication on Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Planning in the European Community<a href="#defann_13_1" name="refann_13_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>). In most EU countries, systems are in readiness to identify and investigate initial cases of pandemic flu. In November 2005, an EU-wide pandemic simulation exercise was carried out, in which all Member States took part, in order to test the national plans and warning systems; a second exercise is currently being prepared.</p>
<p>Both at EU and at Member-State level, substantial investments have been made in research into flu vaccine ingredients and virostatics. At international level, the EU and the World Health Organisation regularly hold European workshops on contingency planning for pandemics.</p>
<p>The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) constantly assesses the Member States' contingency plans and makes recommendations for improvements.</p>
<p>The Member States and the Commission have made great progress in preparing the EU for a pandemic by means of joint action and with the support of EU agencies such as the ECDC.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Council’s video streaming project is a new project. It has been running since September 2006, but is being developed further in many respects and, hence, can still be improved upon. It is part of the general effort by the Council to make its activities accessible to the public. The goal of the project is to enable Internet users to follow open events at the Council, thus including its public debates, 'live' or on recordings. The project is geared to openness and accessibility for European (and other) citizens and is therefore not intended to exclude anyone.</p>
<p>In this connection, the Council’s IT departments are currently working on the question of compatibility with other systems, including open-source software. Open-source users can already follow video transmissions of the Council's open events over the Internet by means of open-source programs such as VCL Media Player, which is available free of charge on the Internet and runs on various platforms such as MS Windows and a number of open-source operating systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0026"></a>

<p>The Council cannot yet make any definite statement as to how political and economic relations between the EU and Serbia will develop this year, as they will depend, inter alia, on certain developments in Serbia and the Western Balkan region as a whole which are difficult to predict. The results of the elections of 21 January 2007 afford an opportunity to form a coalition government in Serbia which commits itself to the necessary reforms and puts the country on the road to Europe, which would, inter alia, entail constructive cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. If such a government were to be formed and to take the appropriate action quickly, this would do much to bring about progress in relations between the EU and Serbia in the next year. If the right preconditions were in place, negotiations on the Stabilisation and Association Agreement could be resumed. However, the talks between the parties belonging to the 'democratic bloc' on a coalition government have only just begun, and their outcome remains to be seen.

<p>The Council is monitoring closely the situation with regard to human rights and fundamental civil rights in Ethiopia, in particular following the elections of 15 May 2005 and the ensuing events.</p>
<p>The EU’s diplomatic representatives in Addis Abeba have identified respect for human rights and the rule of law in general as key topics in the political dialogue conducted with Ethiopia under Article 8 of the Cotonou Agreement. In that connection, they have repeatedly, in some cases at face-to-face meetings with Prime Minister Meles, voiced the Union’s concern at the human rights situation in Ethiopia, and in particular at the arrest of opposition leaders, newspaper publishers and journalists and representatives of civil society organisations. The EU’s representatives have urged the Ethiopian Government to halt the harassment of the opposition and civil society organisations by the security forces and to allow the private media to work freely. With particular regard to the situation of the media, the EU has expressed concern about press freedom and at the high number of imprisoned journalists.</p>
<p>The EU will continue to monitor the situation in Ethiopia closely and raise relevant issues with the Ethiopian Government.

<p>(DE) This answer drawn up by the Presidency, which is not binding on the Council or its members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the February 2007 part-session of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>One of the aims of the EU's Strategy for Africa, which the European Council adopted at its meeting in December 2005, is to ensure that Africa's wealth benefits its people and does not fan conflict. Support for the Kimberley Process is one way of attaining this goal. The Kimberley Process has reduced trade in conflict diamonds to a very low level (an estimated 0.2% of annual world production).</p>
<p>The Kimberley Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) is applied by virtue of Council Regulation (EC) No 2368/2002<a href="#defann_20_1" name="refann_20_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which introduced a Community system for certification of rough diamonds and import and export controls relating to them.</p>
<p>Since the initiation of this process in Kimberley, South Africa, in 2000, the European Community has actively supported it. The Community played a pioneering role in creating the system for reviewing internal controls. In addition, the European Community has successfully advocated the necessary strengthening of this system. In 2007 it is playing a leading role, as the Commission is chairing the Process this year. During this period, the European Community must demonstrate the requisite leadership qualities to implement the recommendations adopted at the plenary meeting at the end of 2006. The objectives for 2007, whose keywords as defined by the Commission are 'consolidation' and 'crisis reaction', are fully endorsed by the Council.</p>
<p>It is largely thanks to the Kimberley Process that illegal trading in rough diamonds has largely been halted. Because of the successful application measures, imports of legally obtained diamonds have risen substantially; countries which can show that they are abiding by the certification scheme have benefited from this. One example is Sierra Leone, where the diamond industry is now one of the principal industries in terms of employment.</p>
<p>In the case of certain other countries, the Kimberley Process continues to play an important part in combating illegal imports. In accordance with the UN-imposed sanctions, imports of raw diamonds from Côte d'Ivoire and Liberia to any EU country have been prohibited by common positions adopted under the CFSP or by EC Regulations. The sanctions are reviewed regularly. In the case of Liberia, the UN Security Council has welcomed the progress made in instituting the requisite internal controls to comply with the minimum requirements. A further review will be carried out within the next six months.</p>
<p>Appropriate financial and technical support is the basis for the effectiveness of the KPCS. Adequate funding essentially has to be provided by the participating States for their territory. At last year's Kimberley Process plenary meeting from 6 to 9 November 2006 in Gaborone, Botswana, it was debated whether and to what extent participating States and the diamond industry could, more than hitherto, provide support for certain participating States or observers. This would particularly mean building up capacity to evaluate rough diamonds and to perform internal controls, and opportunities to participate in review visits. Various individual measures have already been carried out or initiated, for example by Belgians.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>There are plans to hold an EU-Canada Summit during the German Presidency. The discussions are likely to focus on international security, crisis management, energy issues/climate change and trade issues. The EU and Canada are working together in an effort to tackle the key foreign policy challenges facing us, for example in Afghanistan, the Balkans and Sudan/Darfur. Canada is already involved in various EU crisis management operations. This cooperation could be stepped up. Canada's status as one of the world's largest energy producers would make a strategic discussion on climate change and energy issues highly relevant. In the area of economic policy, the central topics are our joint commitment to the Doha development agenda, moves to step up trade relations and the possible resumption of negotiations on an agreement to foster trade and investment between the EU and Canada. The abolition of the visa requirement for all EU citizens entering Canada is an important objective. This issue is regularly discussed with Canada.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0046"></a>

<p>As the honourable Member will be aware, Parliament and the Council are currently examining a proposal by the Commission on roaming charges for mobile telephony.<a href="#defann_23_1" name="refann_23_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> Although action previously taken by the Commission has to some degree resulted in reductions in price and in greater transparency among service providers, the range of international roaming charges is nonetheless still very considerable, and consumers are often still missing out on price transparency, and so the Council shares the Commission’s view that legislation is needed in order to resolve the problem.</p>
<p>The German Presidency plans to stay in close contact with the Commission and with Parliament’s rapporteurs, Mr Rübig and Mr Muscat. Working together with Parliament, the Council wishes to achieve a satisfactory result as soon as possible.</p>
<p>The Council has, on many occasions, argued that the future regulation should be easily implemented and legally watertight in order to become effective without delay and bring about a considerable reduction in roaming charges for end-users, and that it should be founded on the principles of transparency, of better regulation and of consumer protection, while, at the same time, ensuring that the service providers have the flexibility they need to develop innovative new services and to be enabled to remain competitive in the long term.

<p>The Council takes the view that racism and xenophobia constitute direct violations of the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and basic freedoms and the rule of law, upon which values the European Union is founded, and which are indispensable to peaceful coexistence in the EU. The framework decision on the combating of racism and xenophobia does not, therefore aim to draw distinctions of value between one fundamental right and another, but rather to bring them into harmony with one another.</p>
<p>The draft takes account of the stringent requirements that the Member States and the EU itself, in varying ways, impose on curtailments of national and European fundamental rights, in that it is explicitly not intended to touch upon the duties laid down in Article 6 of the European Union Treaty as regards respect for fundamental rights and the general principles of law, including free expression of opinion and freedom of association. It will also accord the Member States the necessary discretion to continue constitutional traditions that have developed over time.</p>
<p>All that having been said, the Council is working on the assumption that the planned framework decision will not have any adverse effects on Europe’s development as a democracy, but, rather, that it can be expected to have a positive effect on the climate of coexistence in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0053"></a>

<p>How does the German Presidency assess the policy within the country and in the region as a whole? What is the situation in southern Lebanon and what will its role be in the event of a generalised outbreak of hostilities in the country? Does it intend to take specific measures in Lebanon to defuse the crisis?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Although the situation in Lebanon remains tense, a certain degree of calm has returned. We are continuing to observe the situation in the country as a whole, Southern Lebanon included.</p>
<p>In the latest Council conclusions (of 22 January 2007), the EU stressed that it is vitally important in terms of the stability and further development of the Lebanon, as well as in the interest of all its people, that a way should be found out of the currently intractable political situation. Such an exit route should be found only through dialogue and with unconditional respect for Lebanon’s democratic institutions, sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence. We welcome the prospects for inter-party dialogue and, with that in mind, wish to express our appreciation of the efforts at conciliation made by the Secretary-General of the Arab League.</p>
<p>Our continued commitment to Lebanon is demonstrated by the undertaking given at the Paris III Conference by the EU and its Member States to commit over EUR 2 billion, and by the deployment of 8 000 peace-keeping troops.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0056"></a>

<p>Acting in breach of international human rights conventions, the US administration has decided to build a wall along most of the length of the Mexican border - 1 125 km. - at a total cost in excess of US$ 6 billion, on the pretext of stopping illegal immigration from the countries of Central and South America. This reactionary move has angered economic migrants and unions in the US and caused outrage among the peoples of Latin America and internationally. This disgraceful decision by the US administration attracted vehement criticism at the 16th Latin American Summit, because it constitutes a flagrant violation of human rights. The increase in repressive measures at the US-Mexican border has led to an increase in the number of victims, since some ten million economic migrants have not been officially recognised by the US authorities, even though they have been living and working in the US for many years.</p>

<p>In her speech to the plenary of the European Parliament on 17 January, Federal Chancellor Merkel, the President of the European Union in the first half of 2007, made it abundantly clear that the Middle East is one of the main priorities for the German Presidency, and this position was reiterated by her foreign minister, Mr Steinmeier, when he met with the European Parliament’s Committee on Foreign Affairs on 23 January. The Council has also clearly expressed its desire to bring the present stalemate in the peace process to an end and to help reduce tension right across the region, and the EU, further to this, has stressed its determination to play an active part in the work of the Middle East Quartet in achieving a comprehensive solution to the conflict between Israeli and Arab.</p>
<p>The Council has been constant in its support for efforts towards Palestinian unity, which have been made under the leadership of President Abbas and with the support of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and of other partners in the region, and it was thanks to these that, on 8 February in Mecca, an agreement on the formation of a government of national unity was reached. For its part, the Council has declared itself willing to work together with a legitimate Palestinian Government that is united on a platform corresponding to the principles of the Quartet.</p>
<p>The Council has called for the immediate and unconditional cessation of all acts of violence and terrorism, and for a consolidation of the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip and its extension to the West Bank of the Jordan. It has urged Israel to desist from all acts that might jeopardise the sustainability of an agreed two-state solution, including the settlement of the area in and around East Jerusalem and of the valley of the Jordan. The Council has also repeatedly stressed how important it is that the agreement on access and freedom of movement be implemented without conditions being attached and that Israel should pay out all the Palestinian tax and customs revenues that it has collected and currently retains.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0061"></a>

<p>Because of the difficult situation in the region, the Troika of EU Ambassadors has not yet visited West Papua, although the Heads of Mission in Jakarta have taken an active approach to this issue. In late January 2007 a start was made on preparations for the visit by a mixed group of embassy advisers in which experts/specialists in political, economic and development matters will take part. The purpose of the visit is to investigate the situation in the region on the spot and to obtain information at first hand from the governors, other political agencies and non-government representatives of civil society. The visit is intended to help the EU carry out a comprehensive, up-to-date assessment of the situation in the provinces of West Papua, including the local need for EU assistance.</p>
<p>As part of its regular political dialogue with the Indonesian Government, the EU repeatedly raises this matter, for example at the EU Troika's annual ministerial meeting with Indonesia. The EU regularly reiterates its call for efforts to be made to secure a sustainable solution for West Papua through the implementation of a special autonomy law, the transfer of responsibility for social, economic, health and education matters to the native population and the settlement of disputes concerning natural resources in a manner consistent with the principles of fairness and the rule of law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0063"></a>

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The EU and the United States are engaged in in-depth dialogue on international law and the combating of terrorism, the significance of which dialogue was highlighted in the statement arising out of the 2006<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> summit meeting between the EU and the USA: “Consistent with our common values, we will ensure that measures taken to combat terrorism comply fully with our international obligations, including human rights law, refugee law and international humanitarian law. We attach great importance to our ongoing in-depth dialogue on our common fight against terrorism and our respective domestic and international legal obligations.”</p>
<p>The dialogue between the EU and the United States also touches on the issue of the status, rights, and treatment of the prisoners in Guantanamo. One object of this dialogue is to highlight ways in which international terrorism might be fought effectively without infringing international law. To a country as committed to freedom, the rule of law and the guarantees afforded thereby as the USA, Guantanamo is quite foreign, and the EU takes the view that the US Government should take steps to close it down as soon as possible.</p>
<p>In the Guidelines for EU policy towards third countries on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, it is laid down that it needs to be guaranteed by a country’s domestic legal system ‘that any statement which is established to have been made as a result of torture shall not be invoked as evidence in any proceedings, except against a person accused of torture as evidence that the statement was made’.</p>
<p>The Council summed up to the EU’s position in its conclusions on 11 December 2006<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>: “The EU remains firmly committed to the absolute prohibition of torture, cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment and punishment. It guides our own actions and we raise our concerns with third countries.”</p>
<p>Further to this, the Council emphasises that human rights, the rights of refugees and humanitarian international law must be respected and safeguarded even when terrorism is being combated. The Council will continue to follow closely developments with regard to human rights in combating terrorism and take adequate measures for their protection. The existence of secret detention facilities where detained persons are kept in a legal vacuum is not in conformity with international humanitarian and human rights law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(DE) This answer, which has been drawn up by the Presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor its Members, was not given orally at Question Time to the Council at the European Parliament’s February 2007 part-session in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council takes the increase in opium production in Afghanistan extremely seriously.</p>
<p>Drugs from Afghanistan continue to have top priority for the EU in the fight against international drug trafficking. The EU resolutely advocates anti-drug measures in Afghanistan. For that reason, the EU supports Afghanistan’s national drug control strategy, a balanced strategy which represents a suitable basis for dealing with the drug problem in the long term.</p>
<p>The EU is continuing to implement its paper on practical measures to combat the cultivation of drugs in and the smuggling of drugs from Afghanistan, which was adopted by the Council in May 2006. We are providing targeted support on that basis. In that connection, on Monday, 29 January 2007 the Council held a meeting with Afghanistan to discuss our cooperation in the area of anti-drug measures.</p>
<p>In connection with all aspects of its support for the Afghan Government, the EU can rely on regular, close cooperation with the United States and other international partners. The most recent instance came on Tuesday, 30 January 2007 in Berlin, when the members of the Joint Coordination and Monitoring Board, the central steering body set up at political director level to implement the Afghanistan Compact, met. In addition, the EU holds regular bilateral talks with the United States.</p>
<p>Long-term, sustainable development is the only way of creating alternative, sustainable employment for poppy farmers. This has been proven in areas such as Nangahar; here, against the background of a functioning administration, and in a safe environment, poppy cultivation has been reduced on a lasting basis. The EU strategy attaches high priority to measures to combat drug smuggling, border controls and alternative development.

<p>(DE) This answer, which was drafted by the presidency and is binding neither on the Council nor on its members, was not given orally during Questions to the Council at the February 2007 plenary sitting of the European Parliament in Strasbourg.</p>
<p>The Council, in response to a proposal from the Commission on the subject, has adopted a resolution on the signing of the readmission agreement concluded between the Community and the Russian Federation. The Agreement was signed on 2 May 2006.</p>
<p>The legal basis for the drafting of a Council Resolution on the conclusion of the readmission agreement was Article 63(3)b of the Treaty on European Union in conjunction with Article 300(2)(1) first sentence of the same Treaty.

<p>(EN) The Commission adopted a proposal on 12 September 2006 laying out procedures and assessment criteria for mergers and acquistions in the financial sector. The intention of this proposal is to provide legal certainty, clarity and transparency of the assessment process whereby competent authorities in the Member State concerned may examine the proposed aquisition, the originator of which may be in the same Member State, another Member State or a third country.</p>
<p>There is no provision in the above-mentioned proposal to specifically protect entities in the Banking Sector from hostile bids and mergers. There are safeguards that apply to all potential acquirers that are aimed at ensuring the continued sound and prudent management of the ongoing entity.</p>
<p>Hostile takeover bids and mergers are a part of the functioning of today's markets. Just as a European entity may bid for an entity in a third country, an entity from a third country may bid for a European entity. The Commission cannot encourage or discourage acquisitions; however, it can strive to provide a more robust legal framework within which market participants may implement their business decisions.</p>
<p>It is also important to note that the fundamental World Trade Organisation (WTO) principle of non-discrimination, the so-called Most-Favoured Nation (MFN) clause, which is laid down in Article II of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), obliges the EC and its Member States to apply the same treatment to all WTO Members as far as market access conditions relevant for trade in services are concerned. This includes the setting up or consolidation of a commercial presence through cross-border investments in the financial services' sector.</p>
<p>The Commission would also point out that holdings and acquisitions in financial institutions are capital movements within the meaning of Article 56 et seq. of the EC Treaty. Article 56 prohibits all restrictions on the movement of capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0048"></a>

The development of the Commission's external dimension was therefore set out as one of the priorities in the White Paper on the financial services policy strategy 2005-2010. The Commission's regulatory dialogue with China is part of this strategy.</p>
<p>The Commission started in 2005 a high level dialogue on Financial Services with the Ministry of Finance and the Chinese regulatory authorities. Two high-level meetings were held in 2005 and 2006 and two technical subgroups in accounting and in insurance have taken place in 2006. The Commission reports widely the result of all its third countries dialogues to all institutions and other interested parties.</p>
<p>In order further to improve coordination and efficiency, the Commission will, starting in 2007, be permanently represented by an official, expert in regulation and internal market matters (on Financial Services) in its delegation in Beijing. This expert will mainly work on financial services issues, will promote the EU regulatory framework and help financial services companies to gain a better market access in China.

<p>On 20 December 2006, the EU Council of Ministers decided to withdraw access to the generalised system of tariff preferences from the Republic of Belarus. This sanction was imposed because Belarus was failing to observe the commitments it had made at the International Labour Organisation on trade union activity. However, I doubt whether the EU will succeed in achieving its aims by such means: sanctions are a blow above all to the Belarusian people and not to the leaders of the authoritarian regime. Experts calculate that the country will lose 44% of its exports, affecting 130 000 workers in the textile industry.</p>
<p>As we know, Belarus was recently also dealt an economic blow by Russia. Despite the above, is the Commission still not inclined to review the situation again?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The scheme of generalised tariff preferences (GSP) is one of the EU's key instruments to respond to the needs of developing countries and to promote sustainable development and good governance. Through the GSP the EU unilaterally offers preferential access to the EU market, while encouraging developing countries inter alia to comply with core international standards related to workers' rights.</p>
<p>However, continuing granting preferential benefits to countries which breach the provisions of the GSP scheme by seriously and systematically violating human rights and international labour conventions, would weaken the incentive for others to comply with these standards. This is why the GSP Regulation provides for the possibility of a temporary withdrawal of the preferential arrangements in case of non-observance of core workers' rights, as described in the International Labour Organisation (ILO) Conventions listed in the GSP Regulation. A detailed procedure, which has to be followed in case of such breach, is set in Chapter III of the GSP Regulation.</p>
<p>Under this procedure, and on the basis of a joint complaint by international and European trade unions, the investigation into the situation in the Republic of Belarus was launched by the Commission in 2003. It confirmed serious and systematic violations of workers' rights in the Republic of Belarus. These findings have also been confirmed by the ILO. The ILO and various stakeholders confirmed that during the four years of the withdrawal procedure, including the evaluation and monitoring period and consultations, Belarus did not remedy the situation.</p>
<p>Failing to react to the findings would not only violate the GSP scheme's requirements, but would also demonstrate a disregard for core labour rights in Belarus.</p>
<p>In this situation, the EU Member States decided on 21 December 2006 to adopt the decision on the temporary withdrawal of GSP preferences from the Republic of Belarus. However, the decision on withdrawal of preferences will enter into force only six months after its adoption by the Council, i.e. in June 2007.</p>
<p>The withdrawal of Belarus from the GSP is not an imposition of economic sanctions; it is the withdrawal of a positive unilateral trade advantage given to this country, which is linked to the respect of certain conditions.</p>
<p>The GSP preferential treatment for products originating in Belarus can be re-established, if Belarus aligns itself with internationally agreed standards, which would assure basic workers' rights and to which genuine application the EU attaches a great importance. The economic consequences of the GSP removal should not be overstated. Only 12% of Belarus exports to the EU benefit from the GSP tariff reduction. Removal of the GSP does not halt Belarus’ exports to the EU but simply reinstates the standard tariffs of the Most Favoured Nation regime.</p>
<p>The EU, while cooperating with the ILO, is keeping the process of internal reform in Belarus under review. Should the violations of workers' rights cease, the EU would certainly reconsider its position.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0073"></a>

<p>On 12 October 2006, among other things as a result of strong pressure from Parliament's Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, the Commission imposed anti-dumping duties on imports of frozen strawberries from China, initially for a six-month period. The decision was taken in response to the catastrophic situation on the EU soft-fruit market which was borne out by the comprehensive report submitted by the Commission special mission.</p>
<p>The sound decision taken by the Commission can improve the situation on the soft-fruit market, but only if the Commission extends the period of period of application of the anti-dumping duties and does not withdraw them at the end of the initial six-month period. If the duties were to be withdrawn, dumping would resume on the European market with redoubled force, resulting in the discontinuation of strawberry production in Europe, particularly in the new Member States.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware of the situation of the Polish producers of frozen strawberries and of the importance of this question to Poland.</p>
<p>This anti-dumping proceeding on frozen strawberries from China was initiated in January 2006 and the Commission concluded provisionally that the requisite conditions were met, justifying the adoption of provisional anti dumping measures in October 2006.</p>
<p>Anti-dumping measures are taken after a rigorous and constraining legal process which aims precisely at shielding the Commission from undue pressure or lobbying and to defend the Community interest. The Commission as always bases its proposals on the verified facts of the case. During the investigation, obviously all interested parties have a right to be heard and to present submissions.</p>
<p>Indeed, any competitive distortions by third countries should be dealt with appropriately. Nevertheless, Community law does require a careful analysis of whether measures are or are not in the overall Community interest.</p>
<p>The Commission received a number of comments after provisional measures were imposed, including from the users of frozen strawberries (jam and yoghurt producers). In its investigation of the Community interest the Commission has looked at whether the imposition of definitive measures would have a very strong negative impact on the jam and yoghurt producers.</p>
<p>The Commission has also noted that prices in 2006 have now risen by comparison to 2005.</p>
<p>The Polish freezing industry has been informed of the investigation and has been given the opportunity to comment. These comments are now being analysed.</p>

Besides, excluding producers of Basmas from the reduction of decoupled aid in 2010 would mean a differentiation of decoupling according to tobacco variety. This is however not feasible.

<p>(EN) It is correct that the draft Regulation outlines explicitly the principles on which the future organic production rules will have to be based. First of all organic production needs to be based on the appropriate design and management of biological processes and ecological systems, thereby restricting the use of external inputs. In some exceptional cases external inputs may be needed. In such cases the inputs should come from organic production, or be natural or naturally-derived, or, when the input is a fertiliser, have a low solubility. And finally, when none of this is available, there is a strictly limited possibility to use chemically synthesised inputs.</p>
<p>Regarding questions 1 and 2 on the fate of products and substances currently allowed in organic production, the Commission can inform the Honourable Member that they will not be prohibited, unless a later ulterior specific decision is taken to withdraw them from the list. As stated in Article 11(3) (c) of the draft Regulation, in the version discussed at the Agriculture Council of December 2006, fertilisers used “for purposes corresponding to those laid down in paragraph 1 of this Article” will continue to be allowed after the adoption of the draft Regulation. The Commission reads this as including the fertilisers currently listed in Annex II to the current organic farming regulation (Regulation 2092/91).</p>
<p>Regarding question 3 on 'exceptions': Yes, exceptions are possible. Article 16 of the draft Regulation sets out a mechanism on flexibility allowing for exceptional production rules in a number of well defined cases. However, any such exceptions would have to be compatible with the overall objectives of the Regulation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0025"></a>

<p>(EN) The central aims of the proposed reform of the Common Market Organisation (CMO) in fruit and vegetables are: to increase competitiveness, to protect producers from crises, to increase consumption, to improve environmental protection and to simplify rules.</p>
<p>As regards the World Trade Organisation (WTO) aspects of the proposal, the Commission proposes to end export refunds for fruit and vegetables, as the role played by refunds for this sector has considerably fallen over the year, and to reinforce the green box character of the aids while maintaining elements of the import system such as the safeguard clause and the entry prices system.</p>
<p>Regarding non-tariff measures, WTO country members are bound by Technical Barriers to Trade (TBT) and Sanitary and Phytosanitary (SPS) agreements which aim to ensure that technical, sanitary and phytosanitary measures are not used as disguised and unjustified barriers to trade. EU legislation provides that products imported into the EU are covered by the same or equivalent requirements. In the same way that they apply to Community products, these laws ensure imported products are safe, marketable and don't pose a plant health risk.</p>
<p>The fruit and vegetables CMO regulation covers only the requirements related to the marketing standards which include, inter alia, minimum quality requirements, classification rules and specific labelling requirements. These rules are identical to the international ones set by the United Nations' Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) and they apply on all products within the EU as well as at import and export stages. Checks are carried out by the Member States and the proposal allows the Commission assisted by the Member States to modify the existing rules on controls when necessary. The Member States report to the Commission on the third countries' fruits and vegetables which are not in conformity with EU marketing standards. At present, there is no concern which would necessitate specific action.</p>
<p>On the export side, the EU system has established an internal plant health status which enables guarantees to be given for many but certainly not all plant diseases for plant products intended to be exported to third countries. However, third countries can and often do require guarantees for pests not covered by EU legislation. In such cases, Member States still have to fulfil third country import requirements.</p>
<p>Third country SPS measures may have a substantial effect on EU exports. The Commission analyses these SPS measures with Member States to see whether or not they are scientifically justified, and if not, takes appropriate action to address them.</p>
<p>In this sense, the principle of reciprocity can be applied in a strictly administrative way, but the EU cannot trade with health standards. The different plant health status in the exporting and the importing country means that the same phytosanitary measures often cannot be applied in both directions.</p>
<p>Precisely in this context, the Commission is currently developing a new initiative aimed at improving market access in the fruit and vegetable sector towards China. In a nutshell, it consists in identifying issues where Member States have offensive interests and to strengthen the negotiation position by speaking with one voice.</p>
<p>This initiative has been discussed with Member States; it will involve creating specific Working Groups with Commission and Member States' experts, which will meet in Brussels to provide the technical input to facilitate negotiations in Beijing.</p>
<p>The initiative could be extended to other third countries where the EU has an export interest.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0042"></a>

<p>In practice, insufficient use is being made of the restructuring aid introduced by the reform of the common market organisation in sugar, which is resulting in ever greater sugar surpluses in the EU.

This would be disastrous even for competitive sugar beet production in the EU.</p>
<p>I believe there are better of ways of reining in the amount of sugar produced in the EU. I therefore call on the Commission to make use of the full WTO export budget of 1.4 million tonnes of sugar.</p>
<p>There is also the possibility of temporary quota reduction, of which use was made in March 2006. I further ask the Commissioner for Agriculture to take urgent steps to stop the announced additional duty-free sugar imports.</p>

<p>(EN) As the Honourable Member is well aware, the Commission is not fully satisfied with the progress of restructuring of the European sugar industry. In the absence of restructuring, the market situation will deteriorate during the next three marketing years due to oversupply and downward pressure on prices.</p>
<p>This leads the Commission to draw two conclusions:</p>
<p>First of all, it is planned to operate a withdrawal in two steps: The first step consists of a so-called preventive withdrawal of production under the quota. In this context all sugar produced above 88% of the quota will be withdrawn in order to prevent a huge sugar surplus building up over the marketing year 2007/2008. This means that producers who produce up to 88 % of their quota will note be subject to withdrawal. If necessary, this preventive reduction of the production would be followed up by a classical withdrawal as foreseen in Article 19 in the basic Regulation 318/2006, i.e., if needed, a separate percentage of all sugar produced under quota would be withdrawn. In February 2007 the Commission will submit the draft of a Commission Regulation fixing the preventive withdrawal to the Management Committee. The further withdrawal would be defined later in October 2007, when the Commission has a clearer picture of the harvest and production of sugar.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Commission has to analyse the situation with regard to the restructuring fund. It has to make it more efficient and ensure that sufficient quota is renounced by the industry in the coming years. Its objective must be to avoid a simple linear cut at the end of the restructuring period to the detriment of the sustainability of the whole sector.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0045"></a>

They “would live in the countryside but need an income outside the farming sector” to compensate for the reduction in subsidies which currently amount to EUR 43 billion.</p>
<p>2013 is an important landmark in the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, which will have to take into account developments in agricultural practices and adapt to the needs of an enlarged Europe. However, questioning the future of the farming profession in this way is unacceptable.</p>
<p>This kind of statement is a provocation to farmers!</p>

<p>(EN) The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) is an integral part of the European agenda. The objectives of the CAP today were formulated mainly in the light of the Agenda 2000 and 2003 reforms and it is those objectives and European agriculture that the Commission is defending today.</p>
<p>The 2003 reform comprised a series of "rendez-vous clauses" constituting a "Health Check" designed to ensure that the CAP operates as it should and meets the expectations and needs of European society. Where appropriate, this "Health Check" could also provide an opportunity for simplification, but certainly not, and the Commission has already expressed its views on this, an in-depth reform which could call into question the objectives to which we all subscribed in 2003.</p>
<p>Since October 2002 and the Brussels agreement, the European Union has a clear Financial Framework until 2013, as confirmed by the agreement on the Financial Perspectives for 2007-2013, on which, as the Commission clearly indicated, there is no question of going back.</p>
<p>However, the financial framework post 2013 is another matter. The mid-term budgetary review scheduled for 2008/09 will lay the foundations for what lies in store for European agriculture after 2013 from a budgetary point of view. It is clear that the overall budget for the CAP will come under close scrutiny. Indeed, some Member States have already gone so far as to express publicly their desire to reduce CAP expenditure, particularly under the first pillar, for the period 2013. So we shall certainly have to be realistic in our expectations of the resources available to agriculture post 2013.</p>
<p>For many years, the gradual changes in the agricultural markets and the world context have prompted farmers to look for sources of income other than that deriving solely from the sale of raw materials produced on their farms. The steady development of on-farm processing plants is a good example of this: producers no longer derive their income solely from the trade of commodities but also from the value-added as a result of processing these commodities. This is only one example of the possible diversification of economic activities in rural areas, which also includes the development of non-farming activities on or off farms.</p>
<p>The diversification of economic activities in rural areas is a key element of our rural development policy, which has been reinforced in the Regulation on rural development for the period 2007/2013 adopted by the Council in June 2005. This policy will play a vital role in maintaining high-quality agriculture and the vitality of our rural areas.</p>
<p>The EU as a whole has therefore a duty to assess and anticipate changes so as to assist European farmers in their process of adjustment by placing at their disposal the necessary stable regulatory framework and the long-term policy orientation beyond 2013.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0060"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission presented its assessment of the link between the immigration policy, the social situation and demographic trends in the Policy Plan on Legal Migration<a href="#defann_51_1" name="refann_51_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> adopted on 21 December 2005. Section 1.2. of the Policy Plan summarised this link as follows:</p>
<p>With regard to economic immigration, the current situation and prospects of EU labour markets can be broadly described as a “need” scenario. Some Member States already experience substantial labour and skills shortages in certain sectors of the economy, which cannot be filled within the national labour markets. This phenomenon concerns the full range of qualifications - from unskilled workers to top academic professionals.</p>
<p>Eurostat projections indicate that in the EU “population growth until 2025 will be mainly due to net migration, since total deaths will outnumber total births from 2010. The effect of net migration will no longer outweigh the natural decrease after 2025”. This will have serious repercussions on the number of employed people in the EU25, as “ the share of population of working age […] in the total population is expected to decrease strongly, from 67.2% in 2004 to 56.7% in 2050, a fall of 52 million […]”. The decline in the total population is expected by 2025 and in the working age population by 2011. Some Member States (Germany, Hungary, Italy, Latvia) are already experiencing a decline in the working age population, while in others it will happen later (i.e. Ireland from 2035). These demographic trends will not affect all Member States to the same degree, but they are trends that should be addressed in a coordinated and effective way.</p>
<p>Immigration does not provide in itself a long-term solution to falling birth rates and an ageing population, but it is one of the available tools within a broader policy mix. In consideration of the low employment and high unemployment rates in many EU countries, priority must be given to actions toward attracting more EU citizens and legally resident migrants to employment, with the aim of fulfilling the objectives of the New Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs, in particular the employment guidelines. In the short to mid-term, labour immigration can – as part of Lisbon Strategy’s comprehensive package of measures aimed at increasing the competitiveness of the EU economy – positively contribute to tackling the effects of this demographic evolution, and will prove crucial to satisfying current and future labour market needs and thus ensure economic sustainability and growth.</p>
<p>On the basis of the above assessment, the Commission has recognised the need to develop an EU policy for the admission of labour immigrants and has put forward what it deems to be realistic proposals for a comprehensive common policy, covering admission rules for certain categories of immigrants needed by all Member States, information and integration initiatives aimed specifically at labour immigrants and their dependents, as well as measures intended to encourage brain circulation and foster professional and linguistic training in the countries of origin. The orientations contained in the policy plan will be implemented over the coming years (2006-2009), according to a precise roadmap.</p>
<p>As concerns in particular common rules for the admission of economic immigrants, the public consultation that followed the publication of the Green Paper on an EU approach to economic migration<a href="#defann_51_2" name="refann_51_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> highlighted, on the one hand, the lack of support from the Member States for a common framework covering the admission of all economic immigrants and, on the other hand, a common interest for attracting certain categories of third-country workers. The Policy Plan announced therefore the presentation of four specific directives on the conditions of admission of, respectively, highly skilled (foreseen for September 2007) and seasonal workers (2008), remunerated trainees (2008) and intra-corporate transferees (2009). In September 2007, the Commission intends also to present a framework directive addressing, among other things, the social-economic rights which should be recognised to all immigrants in employment irrespective of the Member State of residence.</p>
<p>In respect of these future proposals, it should be stressed that the Commission acknowledges that volumes of admission of third-country nationals in the EU for employment purposes remain to be decided at national level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Over the past few years, there has been a significant decrease in the number of positive cases of Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy (BSE) detected in the EU, due to the strict implementation of the stringent risk reducing measures at EU-level.</p>
<p>In 2006, the Parliament and the Council adopted a revision of Regulation (EC) No 999/2001. According to these new rules, Member States which can demonstrate the improvement of their epidemiological situation and the effectiveness of the measures in place, may submit to the Commission a request for a revision of their annual monitoring programmes in their entirety, which may include a revision of the 30 month age limit for BSE testing.</p>
<p>Looking at the monitoring results, positive BSE cases were reported in cattle aged less than 36 months in Poland, Portugal, Spain, the United Kingdom and Germany. However, the young cases seem to be rare events in Members States as the overall prevalence in young animals shows a decreasing trend. All details concerning these cases can be found in annual reports on Transmissible Spongiform Encephalopathy (TSE) monitoring and testing that the Commission publishes each year and which are available on the Directorate General Health and Consumer Protection (DG SANCO) web-site<a href="#defann_56_1" name="refann_56_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Coming to the Honourable Member's last point linked to future amendments, let the Commission be very clear. Any adaptations made to the BSE measures in the future will not in any way affect the Commission's fundamental objectives of BSE eradication and the protection of the EU citizen. These have always been, and will continue to be, the first consideration. The main purposes of the current cattle testing programme are to follow the evolution of BSE prevalence and to monitor the effectiveness of the control measures in place such as the feed ban. However, the removal of specified risk material is the main measure to protect the consumer. An increase of the age limit for testing in the framework of a general review of the cattle testing programme will only be accepted for Member states where positive trends are observed and after an appropriate scientific assessment of the possible risks.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the difficulties which are currently being encountered by national authorities when they seek to execute fines involving vehicles registered in an EU Member State other than the one where the fine has been imposed.</p>
<p>In that regard, the Commission would like to draw the attention of the Honourable Member to the Council Framework Decision 2005/214/JHA<a href="#defann_59_1" name="refann_59_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 24 February 2005 on the application of the principle of mutual recognition to financial penalties. This instrument aims to facilitate the cross-border recognition and enforcement in the EU of decisions, within the scope of Article 1 of the Framework Decision, which imposes a financial penalty upon conviction for an offence. In this respect, "conduct which infringes road traffic regulations" is specifically mentioned in Article 5, § 1, as one of the categories of criminality where the executing authority is not allowed to verify the double criminality of the act. However, the obligation to execute a financial penalty which falls within the scope of the Framework Decision is not an absolute one, as it contains optional grounds of non-execution or non-recognition for the executing Member States.</p>
<p>According to Article 20, the Member States have to transpose the obligations of the Framework Decision in their internal legal order by 22 March 2007. Therefore, the Commission is not yet in a position to assess whether this instrument would be sufficient to eliminate the current obstacles to the enforcement of fines against foreign registered vehicles.</p>
<p>The Commission is also preparing a legal instrument to improve cross-border enforcement in the field of road safety. The necessary proposal will be made in summer 2007. At this stage, it has not yet been decided whether parking fines should be included in this proposal.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(FR) Banning children from certain hotels in the EU could constitute a breach of the principle of non-discrimination on the grounds of age laid down in Article 21 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. This article states that ‘any discrimination based on any ground such as… age… shall be prohibited.’ The Member States must ensure full compliance with this principle in situations falling within the scope of Union law.</p>
<p>It should be noted that, in accordance with Article 52(1) of the Charter, subject to the principle of proportionality, limitations to this principle may only be made if they are necessary and genuinely meet objectives of general interest recognised by the Union or the need to protect the rights and freedoms of others.</p>
<p>Accordingly, it must be examined on a case by case basis, depending on the type of measure in question and the actual circumstances involved, whether such bans fall within the scope of Union law and whether they can be objectively justified in terms of the protection of the rights and freedoms of others and the principle of proportionality.</p>
<p>As regards the need for legislation in this area, on the basis of Article 13 of the EC Treaty, it should be noted that Directive 2000/78/EC prohibiting discrimination on the grounds of age does not apply to access to hotel services.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to inform the Honourable Member that following the concerns raised by different Institutions, it analysed the compliance of the Polish Law on the Principles of Development Policy ("the Law") adopted by the Polish Parliament on 6 December 2006 with Council Regulation 1083/2006 ("General Regulation") laying down general provisions on the European Regional Development Fund, the European Social Fund and the Cohesion Fund<a href="#defann_65_1" name="refann_65_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, and with Article 249 of EC Treaty, which defines the legal character of regulations as the sources of Community law.</p>
<p>According to Article 249 of EC Treaty, regulations are characterised by their general and direct application in the legal orders of the Member States. Where there is a conflict between a provision of national law and provisions of a regulation, the regulation enjoys primacy. A Member State is not entitled to adopt provisions that could violate a regulation's provisions.</p>
<p>This analysis was transmitted to the Polish authorities by letter of 22 December 2006 from the Director General of Directorate General (DG) Regional Policy to Minister Gesicka responsible for Regional Development.</p>
<p>Article 28.3 in the Law gives the right to the Voivode to supervise project selection (chosen in open competition procedures), along with a veto right in the case of documented irregularities in the selection procedure. The Commission regarded the Voivodes' supervisory power and the veto right as not complying with the General Regulation (i.c. Articles 58, 59(1) (a) and 60). The veto right violates the rights granted to the managing authorities, the regions in the case of Regional Operational Programmes, by the General Regulation. The definition of documented irregularities also needs careful interpretation and explanation in comparison to irregularities as defined in Article 2(7) of the General Regulation.</p>
<p>The Commission considers that the Voivode in Article 28.3 of the Law is situated outside the system of authorities (managing, audit, and certifying authority) laid down by the General Regulation. Supervisory rights should in principle be executed by the certifying and audit authorities (Articles 61 and 62), as well as by the monitoring committee (Articles 63 to 65). In consequence, the managing authority is supervised by these three authorities, which are independent from one other.</p>
<p>The fact that the Polish Prime Minister has decided, according to his competences, to suspend the veto right of Voivodes and apply it only if his consent is given, does not take away the fact that the veto right is not compliant with EC legislation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In its 2006 progress report on Turkey, the Commission expressed grave doubts about the compensation commissions whose task it is to compensate families in south-eastern Turkey for war damage. Payments are made far too slowly, and the amounts paid are far too small. Many potential claimants are excluded by the law because of the numerous conditions which apply, and victims are also required to adduce huge amounts of evidence. This is confirmed by the human rights organisation Human Rights Watch, which has called on the Turkish Government to suspend the commissions until their operating methods have been thoroughly reviewed. On 14 December 2006, Human Rights Watch examined the existing method of compensation and informed the Turkish Government about it.</p>

<p>In its report, the Commission stated that progress has been made, in particular with regard to the compensation Law for losses resulting from terrorist acts. In 2006 the European Court of Human Rights ruled that this law allows for adequate redress for persons who were denied access to their possessions in their place of residence. However, the progress report also raised concerns with regard to the implementation of the law, in particular as regards the methods used by the compensation commissions and their large discretionary powers.</p>
<p>Since the Progress report, the Commission has been informed of further progress on this issue. On 13 December 2006 the Compensation Law was amended. The amendments extend for another year the deadline given for the conclusion of application. This is a welcome development given that a large number of applications are yet to be reviewed.</p>
<p>Furthermore, administrative measures were taken to improve the implementation of the law. A co-ordination body was set up by the Ministry of Interior, with a view to ensure more uniform decisions by the local compensation Commissions.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to its reply to question E-4554 /06<a href="#defann_68_1" name="refann_68_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which also refers to the large difference in Greece between interest rates on deposits and on loans.</p>
<p>In July 2005 the Commission launched a sector inquiry in the field of retail banking services. The first interim report<a href="#defann_68_2" name="refann_68_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on payment cards was published on 12 April 2006. A second interim report<a href="#defann_68_3" name="refann_68_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> was published on 17 July 2006, discussing inter alia competition in current accounts and related services. After taking into account the findings of the two interim reports and comments from all stakeholders, on 31 January 2007 the Commission published a final report and assessed in a Communication<a href="#defann_68_4" name="refann_68_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> the appropriate actions that could be taken on the basis of the report’s findings.</p>
<p>The second interim report includes an analysis on interest rate dispersion in the euro area, and the difference between interest rates on deposits and on loans, known as intermediation margins. The results of this study confirm that banks in Greece have the highest intermediation margins in the euro area. However, higher intermediation margins do not in themselves constitute sufficient evidence of collusion in the Greek banking market. A range of factors could explain this situation, including the business cycle and demand-side determinants (including possible risk-premiums), institutional factors such as regulation and taxation, the degree of market integration and competition within the banking sector concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Recent Commission research shows that secondary school pupils in the 25 Member States do not intend to study science subjects at university and prefer other subjects, which means that numbers of students of science subjects, such as physics, are gradually falling. According to Eurobarometer, over 80% of European adults believe that young people should seek to study science if the world is to prosper in future. Despite this, only 15% of adult Europeans are satisfied with the standard of science teaching in schools. In 2006 the Commission took the initiative of setting up a team of experts to examine which actions should be taken at Community level to improve the teaching of sciences at primary and secondary levels in education.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission shares the concern of the Honourable Member at the relative decline in interest in following science and technology at schools and universities. Further, this is happening while Europe faces a growing demand for qualified human resources in science and technology and skills shortages in areas, such as information and communication technology (as highlighted in the recent report<a href="#defann_69_1" name="refann_69_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of the Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) Task Force). This is all the more critical given the importance of science and technology for European competitiveness. Basic knowledge of science and technology is necessary for citizens to participate effectively in the discussion of many of the key ethical and societal issues facing Europe, while e-skills are becoming a key to inclusion and to access to better jobs.</p>
<p>For all these reasons, increased recruitment and improved gender balance in science and technology studies is a priority objective in the Work Programme ‘Education &amp; Training 2010’ and constitutes one of five European education benchmarks agreed by the Council as part of this Work Programme. Maths, science and technology are also among the eight key competences for lifelong learning, set out in the recent Recommendation from the Parliament and the Council<a href="#defann_69_2" name="refann_69_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>. In the benchmark, the Council has set two objectives: to bring about an increase of at least 15% in the number of graduates in these fields by 2010 and at the same time to redress the imbalance between women and men. Currently the first objective is already achieved ahead of schedule, while the second has seen only slow progress. Slovakia, Poland and Italy are the EU countries with the strongest growth in Maths, Science and Technology (MTS) graduates. Best performing countries are: Ireland, France, and the United Kingdom<a href="#defann_69_3" name="refann_69_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, while Portugal, Estonia, and Cyprus have the best gender balance. Nonetheless, it would appear that in certain subjects, such as physics, the number of graduates has declined in the period 2000-2003.</p>
<p>Recent research suggests that disenchantment with school science, even from very bright pupils, may be influenced by poor perceptions of the image of science, of scientists and of their career paths and of how science relates to their values and interests. Educational content and teaching quality can affect such perceptions. That is why the Commission is working to boost co-operation between industry and formal education and to help education stakeholders to improve the content and practice of learning and teaching methods in science and technology, from school to university. To this end, it has carried out a survey on ‘Science Teaching in Schools in Europe’<a href="#defann_69_4" name="refann_69_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> in the 30 countries of the Eurydice network and is promoting mutual learning and exchange of good practice. This aims to identify success factors for the improvement of policy-making and for the implementation of reforms in science learning and teaching. In addition, the Commission is preparing a Communication on a long term e-skills strategy. This will follow up on the recommendations of the ICT Task Force, in particular as regards the awareness and information of parents, teachers and pupils as to job opportunities arising from science, technology and ICT education.</p>
<p>The 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme of Research, Technological Development and Demonstration provides support for research on science education, on the links between formal and informal science education, and on the links between science education and careers. The team of experts to which the Honourable Member refers will look at the lessons to be drawn from existing European initiatives to promote more effective science teaching, starting from primary level.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>In the absence of binding Community legislation on the safety of nuclear installations, the Commission can only access information based on the good will of the national safety authorities and the operators.</p>
<p>In spite of the judgment of the Court of Justice of the European Communities on 10 December 2002 in the C-29/99 case recognizing the competence of the European Atomic Energy Community to legislate in the field of the safety of nuclear installations, the lack of a qualified majority in the Council made it impossible to proceed with the so called "nuclear package"<a href="#defann_71_1" name="refann_71_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>However, the Commission adopted on 10 January 2007 a package of measures in the field of energy, comprising a Strategic Energy Review and a Commission communication on a Nuclear Illustrative Programme presented under Article 40 of the Euratom Treaty. This Nuclear Illustrative Programme describes the current status and potential future scenarios for the nuclear sector in the EU. It provides a basis for discussing the nuclear option in the context of the ongoing EU energy policy debate. This document shall facilitate a transparent and objective debate on the future role of nuclear energy in the EU energy mix for the Member States concerned.</p>
<p>The new Nuclear Illustrative Programme focuses on recognising common reference levels for implementation in the EU. It foresees the setting up of a High Level Group on Nuclear Safety and Security with the mandate of progressively developing common understanding and, possibly, common European rules on nuclear security and safety. This proposal will be assessed by the European Council in March 2007.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in the event of an eventual accident or incident, the concerned Member State is required to notify the Commission through the Community mechanism for early exchange of radiological information (ECURIE).

<p>(EN) The Commission is actively pursuing a policy for the promotion of the use of biofuels as an alternative to petrol and diesel in the transport sector. Directive 2003/30/EC<a href="#defann_72_1" name="refann_72_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> on the promotion of the use of biofuels or other renewable fuels for transport sets reference values for a minimum proportion of biofuels that Member States shall place on their markets. Those reference values are 2% for 2005 and 5.75% for 2010.</p>
<p>The Commission has just adopted a Renewable Energy Road Map<a href="#defann_72_2" name="refann_72_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> on 10 January 2007, which proposes a binding target for renewable energy in the European energy mix of 20% by 2020, and a minimum target for biofuels of 10% by 2020.</p>
<p>On 31 January 2007, the Commission adopted a proposal to revise Directive 98/70/EC<a href="#defann_72_3" name="refann_72_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which among others places an obligation on suppliers of road transport fuels to report and progressively reduce the lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions from the fuels that they supply.</p>
<p>This revised Directive will play an important role in encouraging the development and market introduction of greenhouse gas saving fuels, such as biofuels. The biofuels policy is also supported by the Common Agricultural Policy, especially following its reform in 2003. While farmers cannot cultivate food crops on set-aside land, they can use this land for non-food crops including biofuels; a €45-per-hectare subsidy for energy crops is also available.</p>
<p>In addition, there is targeted support for research and development, especially in second generation biofuels, which have an even better environmental performance than the currently available biofuels. This is provided, among others, through the 7<span class="sup">th</span> Framework Programme for Research and Development<a href="#defann_72_4" name="refann_72_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a> and the Intelligent Energy for Europe Programme<a href="#defann_72_5" name="refann_72_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The reconstruction of Iraq has thus far cost some 35 billion dollars, finance which has come both from the USA and from Iraqi oil money. It has been reported in the media that between 2003 and 2004, more than 80% of the reconstruction contracts went to American companies. These are also companies with close links to the Bush Administration. The remaining contracts have been awarded to companies from countries allied to the USA in the invasion of Iraq. Only a very small proportion of the contracts have been awarded to Iraqi companies. This situation means that, at the present time, foreign companies have very strong influence over the reconstruction of Iraq.</p>
<p>Does the Commission have information concerning how contracts for the reconstruction of Iraq have been allocated since 2004, which European companies are currently operating in Iraq and whether there are mechanisms in place to monitor and control those European companies which have operations in Iraq at the present time?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The issues raised are covered by the EU regulatory framework for electronic communications in two respects. First, in relation to the rights of subscribers, Article 20 of Directive 2002/22/EC (Universal Service Directive) provides that Member States must ensure that contracts signed by subscribers with service providers of public telephone access/connection specify, among others, the service quality level offered as well as any compensation and the refund arrangements which apply if those service quality levels are not met. Moreover, Article 22 of the Universal Service Directive provides for the possibility that national regulatory authorities request service providers to publish information on the quality of their services and specify the quality of service parameters that should be measured.</p>
<p>Second, in relation to the development of infrastructure, Article 11 and Article 12 of Directive 2002/21/EC (Framework Directive) provide respectively that Member States must ensure that when considering applications for the granting of rights to install facilities, the relevant authority acts on the basis of transparent and publicly available procedures, applied without discrimination and without delay and that, where an undertaking is granted those rights to install facilities, national regulatory authorities must encourage the sharing of such facilities.</p>
<p>Although the Commission acknowledges the Honourable Member's concern regarding quality of mobile telephony infrastructure especially in tourist regions, there is no requirement for specific quality levels in the EU regulatory framework for communications services. However, Member States may request the publication of information on quality service as stated above.</p>

<p>(EN) According to the EC Treaty, the Community has to promote a high level of social protection. However, Member States have the main responsibility for social protection systems. The role of the Community is to support and organise policy exchange. The EC Treaty also provides for the free movement of workers. On that basis, the Community intervenes to co-ordinate the social security systems of Member States. In the field of statutory pension schemes, EC rules ensure that mobile workers can aggregate periods of work in different Member States. The Commission has also recently made a proposal for a Directive on portability of supplementary pension rights<a href="#defann_75_1" name="refann_75_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> which, if adopted, will help mobile workers to build up supplementary pension rights.</p>
<p>The Commission has repeatedly highlighted the importance of building up additional pension rights for the sustainability of European pension systems as a result of the increase of life expectancy in Europe. The 2006 Commission's Working Paper on Adequate and Sustainable Pensions<a href="#defann_75_2" name="refann_75_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> analyses the link between demography change and pensions. It underlines that building up additional pension rights can be done first through the participation in statutory schemes through insured employment and secondly through increasing pension savings – either individually or as part of occupational pension schemes. Furthermore, the 2007 draft Joint Report on Social Protection and Social Inclusion<a href="#defann_75_3" name="refann_75_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, which is to be adopted by the Council in February 2007, indicates that ageing will result in pension adequacy increasingly depending on more people working and on giving people the possibility of working longer. The report also stresses the need for supplementary pension savings and for the extension of the coverage of supplementary pension schemes.</p>
<p>As part of the open Method of Coordination, the Commission will continue to encourage Member States to develop measures to encourage the accrual of pension rights in statutory schemes and increased pension savings, and to reinforce the overall sustainability of pension systems.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission has taken over the Chairmanship of the Kimberley Process for one year, as of 1 January 2007, and has made its plans for fighting against conflict diamonds known through an Action Programme for the Kimberley Process in 2007.</p>
<p>The Commission aims at ensuring ‘continuity through consolidation’, by strengthening core elements of the Kimberley Process such as monitoring or transparency, and also at improving the Kimberley Process’ capacity to mobilise international efforts and react swiftly and effectively to emerging crises and prevent the illegal trade of conflict diamonds, for ex. in the case of Côte d’Ivoire.</p>
<p>The Commission will in particular support transparency and accuracy of statistics, notably by ensuring, for the first time in 2007, the publication of statistical data, and by supporting efforts to enhance analytical expertise of statistics.</p>
<p>The Kimberley Process requires Participants to put in place a system of ‘internal controls’ designed to eliminate the presence of conflict diamonds from their diamond trade. The Commission will, as Kimberley Process Chair, and in line with the decision of the Gaborone Plenary in November 2006, step up efforts to strengthen internal controls. The Commission will also support further consideration of government oversight and industry (self-regulation) arrangements, with a view to ensuring that national implementation of Kimberley Process rules offer sufficient guarantees against illegal trade in conflict diamonds. The complementary relation between Kimberley Process requirements for rough diamonds and the industry’s system of warranties, applicable down to the retail level, will be addressed as part of this exercise.</p>
<p>Moreover raw diamonds together with other raw materials will be discussed at the 2007 G8 Summit in Heiligendamm (Germany), also in the context of economic and social development in Africa. Main focus is the control and certification of resources in countries, where they may finance military conflicts. The EU is actively involved in the preparations of this Summit and will defend solutions that guarantee sustainable trade of rough diamonds.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0040"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission notes that a 2006 Review of the Kimberley Process conducted by 71 governments, industry and Non-Governmental Organisations (ONGs) in liaison with the United Nations concluded that it has been remarkably successful in curbing the potential trade in conflict diamonds to, at most, between 0.1 and 0.2% of total trade.</p>
<p>The main objectives of the EC Chairmanship of the Kimberley Process in 2007 are to ensure ‘continuity through consolidation’ by strengthening core elements of the Kimberley Process such as monitoring and transparency, and also to improve the Kimberley Process’ capacity to mobilise international efforts and react swiftly and effectively to emerging crises and thus prevent illegal trade of conflict diamonds.</p>
<p>The Kimberley Process requires Participants to put in place a system of ‘internal controls’ designed at ‘tracking’ rough diamonds from mine to export. In addition, the Kimberley Process is stepping up efforts by researching the scientific feasibility for ensuring the ‘traceability’ of diamonds based on their chemical properties, as a possible complementary safeguard to internal controls. Moreover, industry has put in place a complementary system of warranties down to the retail sector.</p>
<p>The Commission is overseeing implementation arrangements in the European Union, through Regulation (EC) 2368/2002, which opens the possibility of industry self-regulation through membership of industry associations and codes of conducts as well as spot checks and independent audits. Other - non-EU - countries have their own national implementation arrangements.</p>
<p>The Commission will, as Kimberley Process Chair, step up efforts to strengthen internal controls and support further consideration of government oversight and industry (self)-regulation arrangements, with a view to ensuring that national implementation of Kimberley Process rules offer sufficient guarantees against illegal trade in conflict diamonds.</p>
<p>The Commission notes that the Kimberley Process is a unique arrangement financed by commitments and contributions of Participants, and that this flexible system of financing has ensured the Kimberley Process’ successful operation to date. The Commission has identified as a priority the further mobilisation of resources from Participants, industry and NGOs to ensure the financing of future KP-related actions.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Kimberley Process has stepped up efforts to support the mobilisation of diamond sector-related technical assistance to complement the Kimberley Process as a regulatory instrument.</p>
<p>The EC rough diamond trade statistics are subject to continual verification and improvement by a process of dialogue with our trading partners. The Kimberley Process undertakes an annual analysis of production and trade data provided by Participants to identify any possible anomalies for further investigations. The Commission will further support transparency and accuracy of statistics by ensuring, for the first time in 2007, the publication of statistical data.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0037"></a>

<p>(EN) The recognition of academic qualifications is essential for the free movement of citizens in Europe.</p>
<p>Entry to Irish universities and admission to particular university courses is determined by students' performance in school leaving examinations, and in this case the Irish Leaving Certificate examination. For this purpose, students must first satisfy certain minimum entry requirements, and then, in order to gain admission to a particular course of studies, attain a specified number of points, calculated on the basis of their Leaving Certificate results. The points' requirement varies from course to course: courses where there is high demand require higher points.</p>
<p>In the case of examinations other than the Leaving Certificate, such as the European Baccalaureate, universities determine the manner in which they correspond to the Leaving Certificate and the basis for the calculation of points for admission to particular courses. A number of parents have stated their concern that the manner in which Irish universities treat applications for admission from students with the European Baccalaureate is unfair. The main problem seems to relate to admissions to courses in high demand.</p>
<p>The Commission understands that the Irish authorities have not yet formed an opinion regarding the arguments set out by the parents' groups but they have taken a number of steps to bring the concerns articulated by parents and others to the attention of the universities. As a result of these actions, some changes were made by two of the universities to their admission requirements. More recently, at the request of the Department of Education and Science, the Irish Universities Association (a representative body of the seven Irish universities) agreed to conduct a thorough review of the matter. The Department arranged for all necessary statistical data and other information regarding the European Baccalaureate to be supplied to the Association. The results of the review are awaited.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Board of Governors of the European Schools decided in the course of its January 2007 meeting to launch a study to carry out an external evaluation of the European Baccalaureate. The results are expected in March 2008.</p>
<p>The Commission will continue to follow this matter carefully.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0047"></a>

<p>(EN) On 20 December 2006 the Commission concluded that restructuring aid to Fabryka Samochodów Osobowych S.A. ("FSO") was compatible with EC Treaty State aid rules, provided that certain conditions were respected<a href="#defann_82_1" name="refann_82_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>This decision was reached in line with the Community guidelines on State aid for rescuing and restructuring firms in difficulty<a href="#defann_82_2" name="refann_82_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, according to which aid can only be approved if three conditions are fulfilled:</p>
<p>There must be a credible restructuring plan allowing the firm to return to long term viability. Only under that condition will the aid contribute to maintaining jobs on a sustainable basis in the EU;</p>
<p>The aid must be limited to the minimum necessary; and</p>
<p>Measures must be taken to limit the damage to competitors and workers located in other Member States.</p>
<p>In the present case, the Commission found that the aid was limited to the minimum necessary, and that the restructuring plan of FSO was sufficient to restore the firm's long term viability. However, the Commission also considered that, without appropriate safeguards, the aid could have led to undue distortion of competition. The car manufacturing sector has excess capacity. The aid to FSO will avoid its exit from the market but hence risked shifting the difficulties and the burden of adjustment to other firms and workers in other Member States. In this context, a condition of the aid being approved is that FSO must limit its annual car production to 150 000 units until February 2011.</p>
<p>The production cap was set at a level which, on the basis of the information communicated by the Polish authorities, will allow FSO to make sufficient profits in order to regain viability in the long run. It thus strikes a balance between the interest of Poland to safeguard the jobs at FSO and the broader interest of the EU to preserve a level playing field for all competitors in this highly competitive market.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The Agency furthermore intends to launch a European Patrol Network by May 2007 encompassing the Member States along the southern maritime border, as well as carrying out 2 – 3 pilot projects. A total of €8 165 000, 00 is allocated for these activities in the FRONTEX Agency's budget.</p>
<p>For land borders, the Agency intends to carry out 8 – 10 joint operations during the year in a geograhical area identified by risk analysis on routes of illegal migration. In addition 3 – 4 pilot projects will be launched. A total of €2 200 000, 00 is allocated for these activities in the FRONTEX Agency's budget.</p>

This dataset is based on a survey of telecom operators in 25 countries plus Norway and Iceland. Results indicate that Dygital Subscriber Line (DSL), the most deployed broadband technology in Europe, is available to 84% of the population, with wide fragmentation across Member States. Coverage in rural areas is however lower, and reaches on average 66% of the population. The difference between national and rural coverage is what we call the "broadband gap".</p>
<p>These data should not be confused with those on broadband subscriptions, which are collected three times a year. In July 2006, 15% of the EU25 population subscribed to broadband, but only 7% in rural areas.</p>
<p>The Communication "Bridging the broadband Gap<a href="#defann_84_1" name="refann_84_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>" published in March 2006 proposes the use of various instruments:</p>
<p>Regulation: The effective implementation of the regulatory framework for electronic communications increases competition and stimulates broadband roll-out through market forces.</p>
<p>Funding: The use of public funding is encouraged in disadvantaged and rural areas in full respect of state aid rules. The start of the next programming period for Cohesion and Rural Development policies is a great opportunity for regions and rural areas to invest in broadband and stimulate growth and jobs.</p>
<p>On-Line public Services: Measures aimed at increasing the availability and access of on-line public services (eGovernment, eHealth, education) prevent depopulation and delocation of businesses from these areas and improve the quality of life.</p>
<p>Exchange of best practices: The Commission<a href="#defann_84_2" name="refann_84_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> is organising a conference on "Bridging the Broadband Gap" on 14<span class="sup">th</span>-15th of May 2007<a href="#defann_84_3" name="refann_84_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. The aim of the conference is to promote exchange of best practices as well as to increase the synergy among different policy domains.</p>
<p>Regular data collection on broadband availability illustrates gaps between countries and identifies laggards. The Communication "Bridging the broadband gap" and its follow-up encourage all Member States to revise their national broadband strategies by introducing clear targets and concrete actions. In parallel the Commission has also launched the ambitious initiative on "Regions of economic change" in the framework of the Structural Funds programming, which will set up regional and urban networks, including both convergence and competitiveness regions, on a number of themes such as Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>Marine accidents are becoming commonplace. The collision of the high-speed passenger vessel the 'Segesta Jet' with a cargo ship outside the port of Messina, which claimed the lives of four passengers, the fact that the container ship the 'Napoli' was forced through cracking to run aground off the coast of Devon in the UK, and other marine accidents, attest to the serious structural defects, the makeshift maintenance and repairs to damage to ships, for which shipowners bear an enormous responsibility as they seek to maximise their profits. Moreover, the intensification of seafarers' work, the pressure exerted by shipowners, with the collusion of the public port authorities, to work 12-16 hour days with no leave for 4-12 months, in violation of seafarers' international labour conventions, is yet another cause giving rise to marine accidents. There is thus flagrant violation of international rules on safety of human life at sea and environmental protection in order to boost the profits of shipowners and corporate concerns operating in the maritime transport sector.</p>

<p>(FR) The Commission’s answer that follows below in no way prejudges the findings of the ongoing inquests into the two accidents mentioned by the honourable Member.</p>
<p>The Commission attaches the highest importance to enhancing the quality of merchant shipping, an objective that goes hand in hand with its policy on competitiveness in maritime transport.</p>
<p>The Commission is directly involved in, on the one hand, improving the content of the rules on vessel safety and on the working conditions of seafarers, and, on the other hand, following up the implementation of those rules. Its action is taking place in both the international context, via the International Maritime Organisation and International Labour Organisation conventions, and the Community context. The third package of maritime safety measures, on which Parliament will have its say in April 2007, should be mentioned.</p>
<p>These rules are aimed at all the links in the maritime transport chain, not only shipowners but others too, including shippers, classification societies, insurers, the state issuing the flag and the state hosting the vessels in its ports.</p>
<p>Following accidents such as those mentioned by the honourable Member, the shipowners may be held responsible. The rules applicable must help prevent damage and guarantee compensation. In this context, on the Commission’s initiative, the Community has a system of sanctions at its disposal, which in the case of maritime pollution can be criminal sanctions. At the same time, the Commission proposed to introduce, via the aforementioned third package, a Community-level system of responsibility guaranteeing compensation for the victims.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0072"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement, which was signed on 25 May 2006, does not provide for the waiving of the visa fee for all Russian citizens residing in Kaliningrad and travelling to EU neighbouring countries. Therefore, as from its entry into force, neighbouring Member States will have to charge €35 for visas issued to Russian citizens, except for those for whom the visa fee is waived or reduced in accordance with the EC-Russia visa facilitation agreement or other Community rules. Indeed, a common regime, applicable by all Schengen Member States, on visa fees and exemptions is needed in order to avoid visa shopping.</p>
<p>In this respect, it has to be noted that the EU-Russia visa facilitation agreement provides for the waiving of the visa fee for broad categories of Russian citizens who have legitimate reasons for travelling frequently, such as close relatives, students, disabled persons, persons travelling on humanitarian grounds or persons travelling to participate in sport, cultural and artistic activities. Moreover, the Schengen acquis provides for the possibility for Member States to waive or reduce the visa fee in individual cases, when this measure serves the promotion of cultural interests, foreign policy, development policy or other areas of vital public interest or for humanitarian reasons.</p>
<p>Additionally, since 1 January 2007, the visa fee is fully waived for children under six years, students and accompanying teachers travelling for educational purposes and researchers fulfilling certain conditions.</p>
<p>There are also other flexibilities in the EC-Russia visa facilitation agreement that will temper the application of the €35 visa fee, in particular the more frequent issuance of multiple entry visas, valid for one year and even for a maximum of five years in justified cases.</p>
<p>Moreover, the Regulation laying down rules on local border traffic allows Member States to conclude bilateral agreements providing the issuance of a “border traffic permit” free of charge for travel within the “border area”, which can extend up to 50 kilometres from the border.</p>
<p>In the view of the Commission, the combination of this wide range of measures will contribute to maintain the status quo for most Russian citizens residing in Kaliningrad regarding people-to-people contacts with the citizens of the neighbouring Member States, taking into account that once Lithuania and Poland are fully part of Schengen, the visas issued by them shall be valid for travelling in the whole Schengen area. However, the Commission is willing to examine any further possibilities, which are in line with the Community rules in this field.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2007-0074"></a>

<p>(FR) The honourable Member referred to a letter from a Polish national condemning a situation of which he was the victim. The complainant indicated that he had been working in France between December 2003 and June 2005 for an uninterrupted period of 18 months on the basis of three consecutive work experience contracts. When the last contract expired, he obtained another job in a French company. In his letter, the Polish national maintains that he is entitled to free access to the French labour market pursuant to Point 2.2 of Annex XII to the Treaty of Accession, which states that ‘Polish nationals legally working in a present Member State at the date of accession and admitted to the labour market of that Member State for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer will enjoy access to the labour market of that Member State’.</p>
<p>The French authorities refused him access to the labour market, however, and did not issue him with a work permit. The situation of this Polish national was passed on to SOLVIT<a href="#defann_87_1" name="refann_87_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which was unable to resolve the case. The Polish national therefore approached the Commission in December 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission carried out a thorough analysis of the case. On the basis of information provided in December 2005, the Commission held that the condition referred to in Point 2 of Annex XII to the Accession Treaty had been met. The Commission gave notice of this position in the letter to which the honourable Member refers. The Polish national then forwarded supplementary information on the basis of which the Commission discovered that three work experience contracts had been concluded within the framework of a bilateral agreement between France and Poland. It would appear that, under the terms of that agreement, prior to beginning his work experience in France, the complainant was required to agree not to take a job other than that provided for under the conditions of his entry into France. In breach of that undertaking, he looked for another job in France on the basis of Annex XII of the Accession Treaty, In the light of this new information, the Commission concluded that the Polish national in question could not be deemed to have been admitted to the French labour market for an uninterrupted period of 12 months or longer pursuant to Annex XII to the Accession Treaty.</p>
<p>Under the discretionary powers invested in the Commission by the Treaty<a href="#defann_87_2" name="refann_87_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, the Commission decided that it had no obligation to follow up the case because it had not been demonstrated that there had been a general and ongoing administrative practice that was in breach of Community law.</p>
<p>The Commission nevertheless forwarded useful information to the Polish national in its last letter in case he wished to initiate proceedings at national level.</p>
<p>As regards the second phase of the transitional periods, France has decided to maintain national measures or those arising from bilateral agreements until the end of the five-year period after accession, that is to say, until the end of April 2009. This means in practice that the application of Community law as regards access to the French labour market for Polish nationals will be delayed by three extra years and that France has the right to apply national law when it comes to access to the labour market. In this context, France has also indicated that it plans to liberalise access to the labour market in some sectors for which work permit procedures would be simplified. According to the Accession Treaty, France must, however, comply with the standstill clause and principle of Community preference.</p>
<p>The Commission remains prepared to examine any further information that the honourable Member may have so as to establish whether there has been a violation of Community law.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>
