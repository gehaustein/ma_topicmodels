<p class="contents"><img src="/doceo/data/img/arrow_summary.gif" align="absmiddle" alt="" />  <span class="doc_subtitle_level1_bis"><span class="bold">Záborská (PPE-DE)</span></span>  , <span class="italic">author</span>. <span class="bold"></span> <span class="italic">(SK)</span> Mr President, Madam Commissioner, on Sunday 17 October the international community observed the International Day for the Elimination of Poverty, in order to draw attention to poverty as a violation of human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">We are endeavouring to eliminate poverty, but, if we are to succeed in this, society must redouble its efforts. It must take as its starting-point the experiences of those who actually live in poverty, and of the families that reject poverty and do everything to ensure a better future for their children. Such people are a lasting testimony to the idea that wherever there are women, children and men condemned to a life of poverty, their human rights are violated. It is our fundamental duty to unite in order to ensure that these rights are respected throughout the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">On 17 October 1987, in response to the call of Father Jozef Brezinsky, 100 000 defenders of human rights gathered in rue Trocadero in Paris to pay their respects to the victims of hunger, violence and ignorance. They demonstrated their opposition to poverty and called on the human race to unite in order to ensure respect for human rights.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Parliament subsequently adopted this position in its annual reports on basic human rights in the European Union. In 1996, in the same spirit, the United Nations launched its first Decade for the Elimination of World Poverty. Through the Lisbon Agenda the European Union also became active in this area. Allow me to mention two important points that relate to this problem.</p>
<p class="contents">The first is the adoption of a position on participation. It is important for the poorest members of society to participate directly in the planning, implementation and evaluation of programmes and strategies. The World Bank, for example, has adopted precisely this type of participatory approach in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the European institutions are concerned, there should be much more determination and conviction, as well as the appropriate instruments, if they are to be able to act effectively. In spite of the finest resolutions, European Community policy has not been sufficiently successful in dealing with the feminisation of poverty. Programmes to counter social exclusion often lack specific measures aimed at women. I am thinking, above all, of single mothers, widows, handicapped women and pensioners, women who have become dependent on others, and also of women who suffer sexual discrimination within their ethnic group or other minority.</p>
<p class="contents">In short the European project has failed to create equal opportunities. I am, however, filled with pride when I see women taking on important responsibilities with respect to inter-generational solidarity within the framework of the family. I am convinced that each and every woman can have a positive influence on the ways in which society is organised and its structure is shaped.</p>
<p class="contents">Since all women support basic human values like truth and justice, love and freedom, they should be supported in the fostering and propagation of these values in their family and professional lives. I would like to pay special homage to those who live far from their homes or in difficult conditions, but who manage to overcome their suffering and exhaustion in order to help their nearest and dearest. In this respect I utterly condemn those people traffickers who exploit vulnerable women and children like these.</p>
<p class="contents">The second important aspect is the Internal Stability Pact. It is generally recognised that poverty is a real test for democratic systems. In spite of this, the European Union heads of state and their governments have refused to recognise the elimination of poverty as one of the aims of the European Union in the draft Constitutional Agreement.</p>
<p class="contents">Many have already heard of the Stability and Growth Pact. On 17 October I would like to introduce another kind of stability pact, an internal stability pact, which would give women and impoverished families more self-esteem and dignity, a pact that would open the doors of society to women and the poor. We should support this pact for internal stability within an enlarged Europe and eliminate poverty, thereby promoting solidarity between generations, outlawing discrimination, and encouraging equality of opportunity and constructive dialogue, so that together we can build a genuine partnership with the weakest members of society. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Thank you also, Mrs Záborská, for your passionate speech.</p>
<p class="contents">I cannot, however, go along with your general assertion that the European Union has failed to bring about equality. From the very beginning of the European Union, equality of opportunity has had a major role both in the Treaty and in legislation, and much has been achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true, though, that poverty, and consequently social exclusion, are more of a threat to women, including those in Europe’s Member States – whether in or out of work, whether young or old – than to men. Very many women have no secure income of their own and are financially dependent on their families or obliged to rely on minimal incomes. Many women of pensionable age have an inadequate pension or none at all, whether because they have never worked, have stopped working, have been obliged to stop working, or were employed part-time.</p>
<p class="contents">What is especially alarming is that, where families are in poverty, the burden falls to a disproportionate extent on women. There are two causes underlying this: one is the gender-specific aspects of working life and the other is the gender-specific division of labour in families. Single-parent families, most of which, as you have said, consist of women with children, very often find themselves in financial need, and we should have particular respect for women bringing up children on their own.</p>
<p class="contents">The adverse effects are compounded in the case of women belonging to at-risk or excluded groups such as immigrants, ethnic minorities or the disabled. Such women are very often the victims of multiple discrimination, something that has ceased to be acceptable, and this is where our campaign against poverty and social exclusion must start.</p>
<p class="contents">The efforts of the actors at European and national level to combat poverty among women and what you have termed the feminisation of poverty may be observed in the context of the open method of coordination in the field of social inclusion. Even though primary responsibility for this still lies with the Member States, the European Commission and the Social Protection Committee have an important part to play in effectively implementing the principle of gender mainstreaming.</p>
<p class="contents">Among the shared goals underpinning the process is gender balance, which is to be taken fully into account when drawing up action plans at national level. Such plans should also provide for measures geared to the specific needs of women, with the Member States being required to ensure the involvement of non-governmental organisations dealing with women’s specific needs in the development, follow-up and evaluation of the national action plans. Along with the open method of coordination in the spheres of poverty and exclusion, there is to be a Community action programme running until the end of 2006, and cooperation between the Member States in combating social exclusion is also to be supported.</p>
<p class="contents">It is worth mentioning that one criterion for the granting of financial aid – in the Structural Funds, for example – is the promotion of gender equality. As has already been mentioned, the Commission is aware that it is women in particular who are at risk of poverty when they reach retirement age. It is in relation to this that the open coordination method has also been applied to such issues as the adequacy of pensions and the financial sustainability of pension systems.</p>
<p class="contents">A series of initiatives taken at EU level over recent years have helped to give practical expression to the concerns raised by your House in its 1994 resolution on women’s poverty in Europe. These include, for example, not only the measures under the open method of coordination, but also the reversal of the burden of proof in legislation on gender equality and the latest directive based on Article 13 of the Treaty establishing the European Communities. Gender mainstreaming has been included in the European employment strategy, and reform of the Structural Funds involves giving them an even stronger gender equality dimension.</p>
<p class="contents">I am sure we are all agreed that reliable and specific data are needed if strategies are to be effective and focussed. Data, broken down by gender, are of crucial importance in combating poverty and social exclusion; without them, indicators cannot be watertight. The open method of coordination in relation to social exclusion uses a number of common indicators, supplemented by national data, as a framework for exchange and analysis. The breakdown of all indicators by gender is standard; they must also be divided up by reference to age in order to take special account of children and child poverty. The Commission regularly publishes quantitative information on poverty and social exclusion, and this is broken down by gender and age.</p>
<p class="contents">I can assure you that the Commission is aware of the problems of women in poverty. It is also aware that poverty is one of the principal reasons and causes underlying the trafficking in women and other forms of sexual exploitation. I would like to press home the point that none of us – the European institutions, the Member States or society – can tolerate women falling victim to exploitation, whether this be sexual or takes some other form. We must continue to act decisively and make further effort to combat the causes that exist. We must ensure that more economic possibilities are open to women, that they gain greater economic independence and full access to economic resources, to support and assistance and to education. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It particularly caught my attention and I automatically thought that such a billboard would not be out of place in our societies, in the European Union. Unfortunately, we all need to realise this, even we who are responsible for policy-making and come into daily contact with reality, because it is something which offends our democracy and brings the effectiveness of our policies into question.</p>
<p class="contents">The statistics we have at our disposal are both revealing and worrying. An average of 15% in the European Union of the 15 at least, in the old European Union; anyway, the problem is chronic in most countries. Nor is the situation uniform and this is something which we should pay particular attention to, in order to find out why the situation is better in some places than others and what good results are being achieved.</p>
<p class="contents">From Sweden to Ireland and from the countries of the south to the new Member States, the situation is very serious everywhere for certain groups, such as the unemployed, single parents, the elderly living alone and families with large numbers of children and women are in the majority in all these groups.</p>
<p class="contents">The citizens of the European Union – and women especially – have extremely acute concerns and demands, as we all saw during the European elections. That time is still very close. The debate on the Constitution will focus on these issues, if my experience is anything to go by. Let us all be prepared for that; we need to prepare not only our responses to the dialogue, but also our policies, at both European and national level. The debate on the financial perspectives for 2007-2013, the new regulation on the Structural Funds and next year's budget give us ample opportunity to turn our attention to these matters. However, it is not only the financial resources which we provide for employment and social support policies that count. A better qualitative approach to the evaluation of our policies is needed. We need to see if the money we provide is having an effect, at least in accordance with our wishes and calculations.</p>
<p class="contents">Are the European Commission and the Council (which is absent today, as usual during such debates) satisfied with the evaluation being made of the national action plans on employment, the national action plans for social integration, the results of coordination, to which you referred, Commissioner? Are they getting to the root of the problems and the results? Has the gender dimension been substantively integrated? The Committee on Women's Rights and Gender Equality has insisted many times and has made numerous recommendations on efficient and substantive gender integration. However, for this special studies and research are needed, statistics need to be collated by category and, as you mentioned Commissioner, indicators are needed. We also need, of course, to look at all the statistics we collate at a harmonised level, because the statistics of certain Member States of the European Union are not harmonised. Harmonisation is necessary if we are to be able to collate real data and have comparative tables which will allow us to make better use of our policies of exchanging best practices. I believe that this is vital, not only to our cohesion in the Europe of the 25, but also to preparations for a new enlargement and to the success of the objectives of development aid in our foreign relations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

One might say that, at the Beijing World Conference on Women, Europe stood out as a beacon of women’s rights. We have always spearheaded them, and thus it is particularly painful that we have been unable to bring about any decisive reduction in the gap between the poor and the well-off in Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">I see poverty as having a woman’s face, and the facts make it apparent to all that there is still much to do to change that situation. Women still make up the majority in the groups at risk: the long-term unemployed, the lone parents and the impoverished elderly. It is particularly painful and tragic that children are at particularly high risk of poverty in our prosperous society, and let me just say that I was therefore particularly outraged by Mr Buttiglione’s discriminatory remarks about mothers who bring up children on their own. That is something we must not put up with nor allow to go unchallenged.</p>
<p class="contents">It is in education that the gender gap becomes glaringly apparent. A reading of UNESCO’s figures reveals that the lack of education is one of the key factors forcing women into poverty. Another factor in Europe is that we women are employed under insecure conditions; there is also the exceptionally high incidence of violence in these social groups. Maternal mortality is on the rise, and the lives of women living in poverty are at particular risk. Women are also especially hard hit by the epidemic of HIV and Aids, currently representing the majority of those newly infected worldwide. All these aspects we have to take into account and redouble our efforts to deal with them. The economic losses resulting from them are enormous, and so, when implementing the Lisbon strategy, and on the points to which the Commissioner referred, we should really press the point home that the key element underpinning the European social model is, in the final analysis, women’s development and support for them, and that we in Europe really do have the most generous resources for further empowering women and thereby making European society more human.</p>
<p class="contents">We on the Committee on Women’s Rights and Gender Equality demand that these points be incorporated in future major projects on the European social model, in the Progress programme, in the Structural Funds and in the new employment guidelines. The Constitutional Treaty provides us with good instruments for this purpose; let us make it come alive and, by means of gender mainstreaming, give women pride of place in our deliberations. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Nor do we have to be told that women are hit harder by poverty than men. For many years, we have talked about development, aid and solidarity, but in practice far too little money has been made available. We in the rich part of the world have, however, obtained large amounts of money at the expense of poor people far away. This applies above all to the EU, to which I am nonetheless thoroughly proud to belong.</p>
<p class="contents">Poverty both within and outside the EU hits women harder than men. In and outside Europe, poverty is particularly widespread among women living in the countryside. When people can produce their own food, they have made at least a little progress in the fight against poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">How can we in Europe help women in the very poorest countries? For me, the answer is simple. A large proportion of the world’s farmers are, in actual fact, women, and the EU has a crucial role to play regarding the developing countries’ food supply. Our agricultural policy with its subsidies, including export subsidies, is a direct impediment to families in developing countries being able to produce food to sell and being able to export products to our part of the world.</p>
<p class="contents">Through our policy, we are excluding them. By subsidising our own producers, we are dumping the prices on their market. Our agricultural policy is a disgrace to the EU. As you know, the responsibility does not lie with this House. It is no secret that Europe’s Heads of State or Government bear responsibility for the fact that approximately half of the EU budget helps make the world’s poor still poorer. This reverse aid policy must be brought to an end.</p>
<p class="contents">Yesterday, Commission President-designate Barroso received a rebuff. The fact that, here in Parliament, we succeeded in getting our act together and clearly emphasising that we did not accept a Commission based on homophobia and misogyny is a great victory. We in Parliament have the opportunity to do much more. Hopefully, we shall also be able to do away with the shameful agricultural policy. Only then shall we be able to say that the European Union is doing something to combat poverty. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Poverty hits single parents, above all women with children, especially hard. Our society may well talk about children being its wealth, but the end result is poverty for the people who have many of them. This is indeed scandalous, and I believe that the Commission, in the Lisbon process and elsewhere, must do much more. There is a need for more employment for women, and it must be one of the EU’s most especial concerns to do more about childcare, in order to improve the situation as regards education and childcare.</p>
<p class="contents">We know too that older women are particularly affected. The removal of discrimination against women in private pension provision represented one small step in the right direction, but, here too, there still remains much more to be done. There are far too few indicators at European level to facilitate progress in the battle against poverty among women, and too little account is taken of the issue when making policy. The Commission needs to take another great leap forward in order that more account may be taken of women’s issues, of equality for women, in the EU’s policy areas.</p>
<p class="contents">There are too few statistics to really back that up. I hope that the Commission will keep to its timetable for the Gender Institute and that there will be no further delays. As the Council has emphasised, we need the Gender Institute, not only to collate these statistics, but also, perhaps, to derive conclusions from them.</p>
<p class="contents">Let me finally mention one point that has not been made so far, namely women and the environment. We know that the destruction of the environment increases the risk of poverty, particularly in what we call the Third World. It follows that sustainable development must continue to be at the top of the list of priorities on the agenda. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Is that not reason enough for abandoning the neo-liberal economic policy with its Stability and Growth Pact and convergence rules? This policy has, of course, proved not to lead to equality or reduced poverty. On the contrary.</p>
<p class="contents">Patriarchal power structures permeate the whole of our society, in both the Member States and, above all, in the European Union. Gender equality is definitely not a feature of the EU’s economic policy which is, in large part, designed by and for men. Gender equality is a feature neither of economics, politics, education nor health care.</p>
<p class="contents">Nor is poverty characterised by gender equality. Women are hit hardest and are most exposed to poverty and to the consequences of living in poverty. I have to acknowledge that it is sometimes quite wearying year after year to hear people in power coming out with fine words about, for example, objectives in terms of gender equality and of reduced poverty for women and, at the same time, to know that extremely little is happening in terms of practical action.</p>
<p class="contents">Female poverty is not a law of nature. Nor should it be. With the right political and economic decisions, this state of affairs can be changed. I also want to ask why the principle of ‘gender mainstreaming’ has still not been implemented. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Statistics show that of the EU’s 450 million inhabitants, over 65 million suffer from poverty or even live in destitution that is an affront to their human dignity. In the countries that recently joined the European Union, the problem has been particularly exacerbated by a drop in production, an increase in the level of unemployment and the economic expansion of rich countries. This is especially true of my homeland, Poland.</p>
<p class="contents">In my opinion, enlargement of the EU cannot be said to be a success if it is occurring at the cost of great suffering, distress and injustice, along with a widening of the gap between the rich and the poor. When poverty turns into destitution, it becomes a threat to peace. As the Holy Father John Paul II reminds us, ‘if you want peace, reach out to the poor’. Poor countries are not only up against the problem of debt. They have to face many other disturbing problems including lack of access to education and health care, mental disorders, depression, suicide, addiction, various diseases, the forced prostitution of women and children and even human trafficking. They also have to deal with the problem of migration and the threat it poses to the stability of the family, or in other words to that of the whole of society. Stressful working conditions and the exploitation of workers mean that the future appears ever more uncertain.</p>
<p class="contents">The impact of poverty is felt most by those who live in rural areas, by the unemployed, disabled people and invalids, the majority of whom are children and women. These latter should be afforded special protection, as they are responsible for raising the next generation. It is women, weighed down not only by housework but also by paid employment, who shoulder the enormous burden imposed by the effects of the transformation process, and this holds true for my country as well. Ever-increasing numbers of people in Poland are affected by poverty. On a global scale, women carry out two thirds of all work, but are said to receive less than 5% of global income, and own less than 1% of global property. Thought should therefore be given to whether the illusory and superficial increase in the percentage of women in governing bodies can compensate for these injustices. It is important to consider whether the Community’s key watchwords of democracy, equal rights and equal opportunities should not be replaced by respect for moral principles and changes to economic mechanisms to guarantee a more equal division of property. Concrete measures to provide active help and care for those who need it are probably called for. Dealing with the issue in a mature way means adopting an in-depth approach. If this is not understood, the material poverty of millions will be as nothing in comparison to the spiritual destitution of the powerful and wealthy of this world. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

There is even evidence to suggest that poverty is becoming an increasingly feminine problem.</p>
<p class="contents">This poverty is due to obvious social factors and, crucially, to inequalities between girls and boys in terms of access to schooling, university education and professional training. Without training, no job and no salary. Without a salary, no social security contributions and therefore no medical or social insurance, no unemployment benefit and no pension. It follows that poverty increases with illness and, when old age comes, the situation becomes desperate. Nevertheless, these women have undeniably made a significant contribution to society throughout their lives by raising their children and doing jobs that are menial, badly paid and, usually, undeclared. As you will be aware, this poverty is also the cause of discrimination against women and trafficking in women.</p>
<p class="contents">I therefore believe that it is vital to tackle this evil at its roots, because scattering individual subsidies around will not solve the problem for good and will not eradicate poverty amongst women. We must do all we can to ensure that they have equal access to schooling and professional training. That is where we need to start in our fight against poverty which particularly affects women. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Firstly, a lot of research has shown that women have borne the main part of the burden of transition in the new Member States, both from the psychological point of view and the socio-economic point of view. This is also closely linked to the feminisation of poverty. Both unemployed and employed women run the risk of poverty. As far as employed women are concerned, this applies in particular to the lowest paid professions and is primarily the result of the fact that women’s pay has long been around 25% lower on average than men’s pay. This is not an exception but an average that applies to virtually the whole of Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of unemployed women, it is the elderly in particular who find themselves in the most complex and difficult situations. In some countries, time spent raising children has not been taken into account and this particularly applies to single mothers.</p>
<p class="contents">It has also been shown that the opportunity to get out of the poverty trap is reduced where there is little work and long-term unemployment, and that the opportunity is further reduced the longer a person has been unemployed. In my home country of Slovakia, according to the latest statistics issued by the Statistics Office and calculated according to Eurostat methods, up to 21% of the population is at risk of poverty or lives below the poverty line.</p>
<p class="contents">My second observation is that one of the most important dimensions in sustainable development is the social dimension, and poverty in particular. The feminisation of poverty is not a problem restricted to the new Member States. Moreover, it is quite clear that poverty amongst women often results in the social exclusion of children, thereby impacting on the future prospects of the new generation.</p>
<p class="contents">I also support the view that these questions are urgent, including the need to strengthen gender-specific statistics within the framework of building a knowledge-based society. I also agree that certain countries, and in particular the governments of certain countries, are attempting to make light of the problem of poverty, as if it were a symptom of personal failure.</p>
<p class="contents">I expect the European Commission to take a more robust policy in this respect too.</p>

This is not exclusively a women’s problem, but it does particularly affect women. Women earn lower salaries and receive a lower level of social protection. They are the last to gain access to permanent work and the first to be laid off. Women’s economic dependency places constraints on their freedom. As for poor single mothers, how many of them have no means of feeding their children, no roof to shelter them and no government support on which to live with a minimum of dignity?</p>
<p class="contents">These single mothers, whom Mr Buttiglione chose to insult, are real heroines. Fortunately, Parliament gave him the response he deserved and I was delighted to hear Mrs Schreyer say that we must respect single mothers. I trust that Mr Barroso will also keep this in mind in the future.</p>
<p class="contents">Everything is linked: poverty, disease, illiteracy, lack of academic success, infant and maternal mortality, urban and environmental decay, social discrimination, lack of professional qualifications, unemployment, promiscuity, domestic violence, trafficking in human beings. Around 700 000 women and children every year are seized by networks of human traffickers. The European Institutions cannot turn a blind eye to this shocking figure. It is because of poverty that more children than ever are abandoned, raped, trafficked, beaten up and even murdered by their own parents. Everything is linked, such as poverty and death due to backstreet abortion, as we showed recently in this House with regard to the case of the boat belonging to the ‘Women on Waves’ movement. We must not forget that those who suffer most from the consequences of criminalising the voluntary termination of pregnancy are women from the poorest sections of society. Poor women pay with their health and even with their lives for the monstrous laws that prevent them from gaining access to a safe and hygienic voluntary termination of pregnancy. Such is the case in Ireland, Poland and Portugal.</p>
<p class="contents">The fight against the social exclusion of women requires practical measures, as, in fact, laid down in the Lisbon Strategy. What is needed is an updated reading of the Lisbon Strategy to include a gender perspective. The Europe that we want and deserve must show greater solidarity, fairness and humanity towards women too. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Two thirds of all work is done by women, but only a tenth of all income is accrued by women.</p>
<p class="contents">The Beijing Declaration concerning the targets in terms of gender equality, development and peace and an action plan for achieving these targets was unanimously adopted more than ten years ago by 189 countries at the UN Fourth World Conference on Women.<span class="bold"> </span>The EU Member States were among these countries. The gap between words and action is still worryingly large when it comes to women’s rights and, as a result, poverty has been feminised in the world. We must put our faith in women in the poor countries and, in that way, also fulfil the UN’s Millennium Declaration, which states that extreme poverty must be halved by 2015.</p>
<p class="contents">There is no simple solution. Poverty is solved not through money but through commitment to human rights and sustainable development. The award of the Nobel prize to Wangari Maathai is an example of what can be done.</p>
<p class="contents">By guaranteeing women’s rights, land and water are also secured, as well as opportunities for self-provision and local development. We must dare to make demands of the surrounding world. That is why it is important for women to be accorded full status in aid policy, both as aid providers and as aid receivers. I want to know what work the Commissioner is doing in this area.</p>
<p class="contents">To turn the argument around, men constitute almost half the earth’s population. A third of all work is done by men, but nine tenths of all income is accrued by men. This fact also applies within the European Union, and I do not agree with the Commissioner’s description. Wage discrimination is increasing, as is female unemployment. Women have worse health, and they are poorer than men within the European Union.</p>
<p class="contents">Now that we are working on the Lisbon process, I wish to know what the Commission is doing to guarantee women’s rights, achieve sustainable economic development and enable women to appropriate the rights accorded to them. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">The situation becomes worse still as the number of people thus affected increases. Some figures indicate the seriousness of the situation, which, incidentally, varies considerably from country to country. In the EU, for example, over 51% of the approximately 20 million unemployed are women. In other words, unemployment, just like poverty, has a female face and seriously affects the women who are victims of multinational companies restructuring and relocating, as happens in my country, Portugal. On the subject of unemployment, the latest Eurostat figures show that across the 25 Member States of the EU, only 38% of permanent posts are held by women, meaning that most work done by women is insecure. Even so, the overall employment rate among women is only 55%, whilst that of men is as high as 71%.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore not enough to defend the principle of equality. What is needed is a root-and-branch review of Community policies, with priority given to jobs, social inclusion and the fight against discrimination. This would entail a change in the financial and monetary policies of the European Central Bank and the Stability and Growth Pact, which should be replaced by a development, jobs and social inclusion pact. Similarly, with regard to the Lisbon Strategy, the policy on competition and the internal market must be amended to guarantee access for all to high-quality public services in education, training, health care, social protection, public transport and housing, and to promote social inclusion and economic cohesion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">If, on average – as has been said – women’s pay is much lower than men's pay, it is essential that we take effective measures to deal directly with the causes of this discrimination.</p>
<p class="contents">It is true – as you have said, Commissioner – that the employment discrimination suffered by many women is a result of their having had fewer opportunities for access to education and training and also, in many cases, difficulties reconciling family life with working life. This unquestionably has an effect on the nature of their jobs and their salaries, but it is equally true that many women directly suffer hidden wage discrimination, either because many of them are employed in the lower paid posts, or because lower salaries are paid to categories largely made up of women or because reducing women’s rights increases the incentive to employ them. It is therefore urgent, Commissioner, that we prevent, detect and also eliminate these types of discrimination in order to achieve true equality of pay.</p>
<p class="contents">I would also like to refer, although very briefly, to increasing female emigration. For years, men have made up the bulk of migratory flows, while women came to our territory solely for reasons of family regrouping. Nevertheless, the model is changing quickly and in recent years more and more women have been emigrating on an individual and direct basis with a view to joining the workforce.</p>
<p class="contents">The high number of lone women immigrants, whose family burdens are not shared with anyone, who undoubtedly face two-fold discrimination on grounds of origin and on grounds of gender, oblige us, Commissioner, to pay much more specific attention to women immigrants.</p>
<p class="contents">Commissioner, putting an end to the increasing feminisation of poverty is an issue we must all be fully committed to, because we must remember that we are talking about justice and well-being for everybody. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Unfortunately, no one has yet addressed this issue with efficient and radical reform. A new social map is needed, based on a specific and integrated strategy to combat poverty and social exclusion in all social classes, especially among women.</p>
<p class="contents">At European level, the most basic policy for combating poverty is to determine the minimum guaranteed income, which is something which could start to be applied to the female population on the margins of poverty. Such a policy will ensure that the entire population receives a satisfactory income. The minimum income is the income that needs to be used as a transitional stage, for reintegrating women into employment, and combined with development policies inside and outside the Community, with social insurance and health policies, social welfare policies, housing and child support policies, education and training policies, rural development policies and employment policies.</p>

While it would be worthwhile to consider many of the points made, I would like to highlight two of them, one being the connection between the European Budget, agricultural expenditure and poverty – including among women – in the developing world. The statement has been made that something like one half of the Budget would help to further aggravate the poverty of women in the developing world. I cannot allow that assertion to go unchallenged. You made, of course, specific reference to agricultural subsidies, at a time when the Commission, in negotiations within the World Trade Organisation, has made progress in reducing agricultural and export subsidies and opening up greater opportunities to the countries of the developing world.</p>
<p class="contents">Secondly, agricultural expenditure does of course play an essential part in preventing poverty in rural areas and in the agricultural sector. We are all aware of how poverty, rural areas and women are interlinked, and so our European Budget’s programmes for fostering development in rural areas are of immense importance in keeping women out of poverty.</p>
<p class="contents">My next point has to do with the Lisbon strategy. You asked about broad outlines and specific proposals. I would like to remind you that it was the Commission that devoted its efforts to formulating the objective, as part of the Lisbon strategy, of increasing the number of women in employment, and that in a relatively short time. Then it was the Commission, too, that pointed out that it was impossible to simply set an increase in the number of women in employment as a target without giving practical attention to childcare. Without that, the goal of getting more women into work is beyond reach, and, as a woman, I was very happy to learn that the Heads of State and Government, at a summit, had considered the issue of childcare facilities and had come up with a resolution to the effect that childcare needs to be more readily available. The fact is, of course, that you cannot make Europe more competitive without increasing women’s opportunities for employment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">As I understand it, this is an oral question rather than a speech, and so I will try to keep it very brief. As you know, this question deals with the environmental effects on whales of underwater sonar systems, military and civilian equipment that has quite considerable effects on the auditory system of whales. We have, most regrettably, had indications from experts that whales are dying in vast numbers, something that has not started only recently, but has been going on for some time.</p>
<p class="contents">What we would like the Commission to tell us is whether it has been informed of new studies and whether these have been sufficiently publicised. We would very much like to know whether it is aware that the United States has already dismantled stationary sonar systems of this kind. Is it aware that new technologies capable of performing these functions have been in existence for some time?</p>
<p class="contents">We see here the potential for innovation under the Lisbon strategy. We do not want to scrap any ships, but we do want our friends in the defence sector to continue to be able to travel under water in an orderly fashion, rather than, as is unfortunately the present case, in some confusion and disarray. This is an opportunity for innovation; is the Commission willing to take action in this area even outside the European Union? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">At the plenary session in March of this year, Commissioner Solbes made a statement on behalf of the Commission on the effects of low-frequency active sonar on the marine environment, in which it was pointed out that the EU’s Member States are required by Community law to set up stringent systems for protecting whales in European waters. The Commission did not, however, have at its disposal the information on high-intensity active sonar systems and their potential effects on whales that it would have needed in order to clarify outstanding scientific issues and adopt an unambiguous position.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, the Commission asked the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea to examine this complex issue scientifically. This was to provide a basis for the description of measures that might prove necessary in the future in order to avoid disturbing whales and in order to guarantee adherence to the provisions of the Habitat Directive.</p>
<p class="contents">The scientific study has since been set in motion, and the draft conclusions are expected at the beginning of 2005. The Commission will make the results of this study available to Parliament and to the public. We will consult the Member States, through the Habitat Committee, on the best possible options for protecting whales from sonar systems and other forms of noise pollution, and in these discussions all interested parties will be involved.</p>
<p class="contents">Although the Commission is aware of the potential environmental effects of military activities, the fact that the EU possesses no competence in this area means that the Community cannot take any action to regulate the development of new defence technologies. If, in future, we become more involved in the field of defence research, this will of course have a major part to play. Let me reiterate that the study was commissioned in September 2003 and is expected to be available by the end of this year. As the study needs to collate all the available knowledge on the subject, it is a complex task, and, as it has to do with the military sector, this has often not been easy.</p>
<p class="contents">We therefore ask you to note that the completion of the study will require some considerable time. I do hope, though – as I have said on behalf of my fellow Commissioners – that the results will be available at the beginning of the coming year and will then provide a sound basis for action. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We have already brought up the issue of whales twice, and we will do so again in the future, until we make clear progress in this matter. I wish to thank Commissioner Schreyer for her reply, which inspires hope. It is important that the Commission should do all it can within the limits of its powers.</p>
<p class="contents">Two years ago, I personally collected the names for the first oral question, and it has to be said that research material on the subject has substantially increased in volume in the intervening period. Precise information on the effects of high-intensity sonars has been obtained from many reliable sources, including data published by 18 European researchers in the issue of Nature magazine dated 9 October 2003, which shows that high-intensity sonars pose a significant threat to marine mammals in particular, but also to fish and other marine fauna. There has been a considerable increase in the body of evidence showing a link between the death in large numbers of marine mammals and high-intensity sonars.</p>
<p class="contents">A year ago, in October, researchers and our parliamentary delegation went to NATO headquarters to submit two petitions asking the member countries of NATO to restrict the use of LFAS systems until their environmental impact and link to recent whale deaths had been fully investigated. At that time, the petition had been signed by more than 85 000 people and 68 environmental organisations in Europe, the United States and Canada.</p>
<p class="contents">While we agree that it is a totally legitimate exercise to try and develop this defence system, and to monitor submarines that use new technology, it is especially important to take the vulnerability of our environment into consideration. From the point of view of sustainable development, we should aim to develop alternative technologies which protect nature while at the same time achieving the objectives set for them. In military technology, as well as other fields, it is worth reminding ourselves of the ecological price we have to pay for the technology we choose to employ. With high-intensity sonars, the price is too high. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We now have valid and sufficient scientific evidence demonstrating that high-intensity active naval sonars can be lethal for whales, dolphins and fish. All cetaceans are extremely dependent on hearing for their survival, and many species have an acute sense of hearing and use sound not only to locate their prey but also for navigation and communication, often over long distances.</p>
<p class="contents">Noise pollution caused by sonar equipment thus not only causes physiological damage but also interferes with the natural behaviour of the animals and with normal communication. It drowns out calls and disorientates the animals, scaring them away from their usual habitats, where they feed and reproduce.</p>
<p class="contents">Last year we adopted a resolution on the protection and conservation of the marine environment. This Parliament voted unanimously for the application of consistent, coordinated measures to halt the decline of biodiversity by 2010 and to promote the sustainable use of the seas, protecting and conserving marine ecosystems. I would not wish to remind you, Mr President, that these were political objectives to which we gave a binding commitment at the last world summit on sustainable development.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, therefore, that it is our duty to adopt provisions designed to preserve the marine world which surrounds us, and so I call on the Commission to abide by the deadlines which it announced in this Chamber for making the move from studies to concrete proposals. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Instead of the electromagnetic energy waves used by surface radar, it employs acoustic energy waves with which it scans the water of the oceans. These acoustic waves are, in simple terms, very loud noises which travel over many hundreds of kilometres and, in the areas used, completely fill every cubic inch of ocean water without any geographical limitation. Sometimes they are so loud that they can even be heard outside the water by people standing at nearby shores.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not surprising that such high-energy noise bombardment causes severe disruption to marine life. This disruption is especially extensive to animals that by nature have very sensitive acoustic capabilities, such as whales and dolphins. What a whale hears and feels when sonar is used is the equivalent of what we would hear and feel if four jumbo jet engines were operating at full blast in this room. The scientific evidence gathered mainly from necropsies on stranded whales is becoming increasingly stronger and more enlightening and it is convincing to most scientists, and it certainly satisfies our precautionary principle.</p>
<p class="contents">Apart from direct injury to internal organs such as the inner ear apparatus, the sonar waves cause the animals to panic and in terror to move uncontrollably and haphazardly, trying desperately to escape from the painful and disorientating sonar noise. In so doing, they may rise very quickly from deep waters, thus suffering a form of fatal decompression sickness and/or they may be stranded on nearby beaches where they meet their demise.</p>
<p class="contents">It should be noted that for every animal stranded, many hundreds more are killed or severely injured but we never get to know about them because they never reach the shores. It should also be noted that dying from the effects of sonar injury is an extremely painful, agonising and slow form of death.</p>
<p class="contents">It is imperative that the motion for a resolution which has been submitted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety calling for the restriction of the use of these sonars be passed urgently and unchanged in substance. The amendment proposing the restriction of the use of sonars in geographically non-sensitive marine habitats, if accepted, will severely weaken this resolution and render it largely ineffective.</p>

<p class="contents">These new, much more powerful sonars – one of the loudest sound systems ever devised – have sparked an epidemic of strandings, internal bleeding, deafness and lung damage wherever they have been tested. A single blast of the new technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water. That is why it is simply not good enough that the Commission responded to a written question of mine last November, simply saying that this type of technology needs to be used with caution. This type of technology <span class="italic">cannot</span> be used with caution because of the huge impact it has. At one hundred miles away from the source of the sound, the noise can still cause shearing of the tissues in the air sack behind whales' and dolphins brains.</p>
<p class="contents">I listened with great interest to the Commissioner's introduction, and I heard a lot about more research but nothing about calling for a moratorium. In July, the Scientific Committee of the International Whaling Commission unanimously issued a strong statement of concern about intense underwater noise, citing what <span class="italic">it</span> calls compelling evidence that entire populations of whales and other marine mammals are potentially threatened by it. So do not tell us that we need more research before we call for a moratorium – we do not: there is plenty of evidence that we need to act.</p>
<p class="contents">I would strongly urge Members to vote against the amendment tabled by the PPE Group, which seeks to weaken the resolution by calling upon Member States to adopt geographic restrictions in sensitive marine habitats. There is simply no scientific justification for this amendment.</p>
<p class="contents">Mrs Korhola gave a very nice speech – it is a pity she has now left the Chamber – but she did not explain why she has put her name to this very same amendment, which would gut and weaken the very resolution which she claims to support. Given that a single blast of this low-frequency technology can affect animals across 3.8 million km2 of water and that little is known about their migratory patterns, geographic restrictions are not appropriate. They will not work. I urge colleagues to reject that amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It comes from the other side of this House and was tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. They wish to attenuate what is one of the absolutely key points by restricting the demand that this technique should not be used so that it only applies to certain geographical areas. That is something that would seriously damage the document. It is also a practical impossibility, since we are concerned here with species that travel over huge areas of sea and that cannot be confined to certain areas.

In environmental policy too, we are trying to prevent new technical developments from damaging flora and fauna.</p>
<p class="contents">As for the new sonars that are currently under discussion, I can be brief. We see cases of stranded sea mammals whose hearing has been damaged. Those animals are stranded in areas where ships sail that are equipped with a new kind of extra loud sonar. These factors, combined, lead us to believe that those sonars cause damage to sea mammals. I take the view that we should apply the precautionary principle in this instance too and should therefore temporarily ban the use of those types of sonar in European waters until such time as it has been proven that there is some other cause or – if the damage is indeed caused by these sonar devices – until a final ban is imposed. With regard to the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, I understand that restrictions can be imposed on protected areas, but it seems wise to me to retain the current text of the resolution in order to send the strongest possible signal to the Council and the Commission. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">Because of recent research published in <span class="italic">Nature</span> magazine in October, attention has focused on naval sonars. However, the absolute priority for groups concerned with such sea mammal deaths in the south-west of England and many other parts of the country is to put a stop to indiscriminate pair trawling in the English Channel as soon as possible. We are impatiently awaiting EU action on this. My constituents simply cannot understand why action has not already been taken on the basis of the precautionary principle, which the Commission so often cites in support of its initiatives.</p>
<p class="contents">We want more research to be carried out on the effect of naval sonars. I note that the Verts/ALE Group is moving an amendment saying that it wants a moratorium because it has been proved that naval sonars are dangerous. That is not actually true. The research published in <span class="italic">Nature</span> says: 'The incidence of such cases of dead mammals during a naval sonar exercise indicates that acoustic factors <span class="italic">could</span> be important.' <span class="italic">Nature</span> magazine says that further investigation is needed.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that we have to be realistic. Green MEPs support the idea of an immediate restriction or ban on such sonars, but the British Navy, and no doubt others with less accessible websites, are about to conduct trials on a new low-frequency, high-intensity sonar S2087 from Type 23 frigates. The Ministry of Defence admits that there is an acoustic effect that might damage sea mammals. For that reason, it will introduce mitigating and monitoring measures to protect marine mammals. For example, we would prefer to see avoidance of the use of sonar in marine breeding grounds adopted as part of a common EU strategy.</p>
<p class="contents">Blocking the use of such sonars in any EU waters would deprive those who defend us of a useful early-warning tool that we might well need in a dangerous world. It is a difficult balance, but we believe that our amendment to the text delivers the best possible solution. If it is not adopted many of us will, with great regret, have to abstain or vote against this motion. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

During the previous debate, Commissioner Solbes announced to us that this study would be carried out, and I am pleased that Commissioner Schreyer has confirmed what Commissioner Solbes said and that the study will be finished before the end of the year.</p>
<p class="contents">At the moment, the scientific evidence is clear. The University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria has carried out very detailed studies on the subject and it is clear that the low-frequency sonar used in naval military manoeuvres does harm to animals.</p>
<p class="contents">What we need to do now, as Mr Sacconi has already said, is to move on from the study stage to concrete proposals. It falls to the Commission to present proposals to the Member States, concrete proposals, and I hope that those proposals will be on the table when we next hold the debate in Parliament.</p>
<p class="contents">I will therefore end by calling on the Commission to present these proposals very soon, that is to say, immediately after it receives those studies, so that, next year, Parliament can study them and recommend to the Member States what decisions should be taken, without any excessive delay. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I do not know what the PPE-DE Group wants to do: perhaps they should give out ear protectors to the dolphins and whales.</p>
<p class="contents">A number of ziphii have died this summer in the Canary Islands, clearly due to the effects of sonar. The Verts/ALE Group has been condemning this for a long time. The Spanish Government and the Ministry of Defence have acknowledged the problem and the Canary Islands Government recently accepted that this type of harm is related to the use of medium-frequency active sonars.</p>
<p class="contents">Last April, the Government and the Ministry of Defence signed a cooperation agreement to prevent the mass beaching of ziphii which is taking place in the Canary Islands area. This agreement is very significant, since it shows concern and demonstrates that ziphii are affected by sonar.</p>
<p class="contents">What we find completely unacceptable is the amendment presented by the Group of the European Peoples’ Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats with a view to restricting the use of high-intensity naval radar/sonar only in areas defined as sensitive marine habitats, something which is absolutely impossible. We call on the House to reject this amendment. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

It is a fact that the European Parliament is not just responsible for the protection of the environment, but also for security and defence matters, on the latter of which we have set up a sub-committee. I believe that any resolution adopted by us would carry much more weight if it took full account of these aspects.</p>
<p class="contents">I would say that it is extraordinarily important that we should find a solution, and that whales and dolphins have to be protected. About this, I believe there is broad agreement in this House as a whole, but there is, on the other hand, the question of what is the best course of action. I do not know whether it is realistic to call for a moratorium, for the continued use of these devices to some extent will continue to be necessary for security and other reasons. For that reason, I believe it would be more realistic to seek first a suitable geographical limit and come to an agreement that these devices should no longer be used in places where whales and dolphins have died in particularly large numbers. For that reason, I very much commend the amendment tabled by the Group of the European People’s Party.</p>
<p class="contents">There is yet another aspect to this, in that a preparatory programme for safety research is currently under discussion – it features in the Budget debates, Commissioner Schreyer – and it is to be introduced and funded by the European Union. As I see it, the issue of substitutes for sonars, or that of other methods for protecting whales, should be dealt with under the heading of this programme. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The figures in Budget item 209, which constitute the provisional amount for covering the institution’s property investments, will therefore be adjusted so that they reflect the result of the vote we have today. If Parliament decides to follow my recommendations to amend the overall level of Parliament’s Budget – Amendment No 370 – which would reduce the Budget by EUR 40 million, the amount of budget item 209, which is the amount of the institution’s property investments, will be adjusted accordingly. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

The hearings procedure, the importance of which I do not believe I need to emphasise in the light of yesterday’s events, may also serve as a positive example to the Council and the Commission.</p>
<p class="contents">What do I mean by this?</p>
<p class="contents">In the Treaty of Accession, the ten new Member States were granted the right to delegate one member each to, among other bodies, the European Court of Auditors. COCOBU held hearings for each of the candidates and delivered a favourable opinion on the appointment of eight candidates and a negative opinion in the case of two.</p>
<p class="contents">One of these countries, Cyprus, withdrew its candidate because of the negative result of the relevant hearing and delegated Mr Kikis Kazamias instead.</p>
<p class="contents">In the light of his Curriculum Vitae and the answers provided in the questionnaire and public hearing, our committee recommended the appointment of Mr Kazamias with 26 votes for and one against and expressed hope for the prospects of cooperation with the new candidate. </p>
<p class="contents">The Council unfortunately ignored Parliament’s negative vote and approved the other, Slovakian, candidate. The Committee on Budgetary Control has therefore decided to request a written report from the Council by 15 December 2004 as to why it ignored Parliament’s recommendation.</p>
<p class="contents">Members of the European Court of Auditors must have the trust of Parliament. Mr Kazamias had the trust of the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I am therefore asking you to accept the report we have presented to you.</p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We believe that the commitments for 2005 should definitely not exceed the Commission’s proposal of 1.14%. Even though the payments still do not exceed 1% of gross domestic income, these will gradually increase to the level of the commitments in the Budget for 2005. This forms the basis for the long-term financial framework. It is therefore important to come down to a lower level by no later than 2005. The target should be to come down below the expenditure ceiling of 1% of gross domestic income.</p>

<p class="contents">-	We believe that the EU should begin cutting back on agricultural subsidies by no later than 2005.</p>
<p class="contents">-	The subsidy for European political parties should be completely abolished.</p>
<p class="contents">-	The subsidy for tobacco cultivation should be abolished. It should be up to the individual countries to ensure that the farmers affected successfully switch to other forms of production.</p>
<p class="contents">-	The subsidy for information efforts can be reduced because we believe it to be difficult, politically, to provide objective information prior to referendums on the Constitution. We believe it to be the responsibility of the individual countries and of the political parties in these countries to provide this information.

Despite our favourable assessment of certain forms of European policy – in the areas of the environment, agriculture and the internal market, for example – we are of the opinion that, in the Budget amended by Parliament, far too much money has been allocated to matters which, according to the subsidiarity principle, should not fall within the European Union’s remit. Areas that spring to mind are employment policy, foreign and defence policy, tourism, education, culture and sport. In addition, under the heading of ‘information policy’, a great deal of money has been set aside for promotional activities for a so-called European Constitution, to which we are avowedly opposed.</p>

Without prejudice to any future corrections, it is possible to conclude that what runs through the whole of this budget is major concern for institutional reform (increase in appropriations for expenditure in respect of staff in active employment; increase in administrative expenditure; increase in expenditure on financial control). It is a pity that the Council’s draft budget for the financial year 2005 is, in total, equal to 1% of the Gross National Income (GNI) of the 25 EU Member States, maintaining the pressure – publicly defended by various Member States – to lower the 1.24% ceiling. Such a move would hold back the recent accession of ten new Member States and, indeed, attempts to advance institutional Europe.</p>

<p class="contents">Under pressure from Parliament, the Commission adopted a new activity-based management approach (ABM).</p>
<p class="contents">It is a good, simple idea.</p>
<p class="contents">The first task is to identify activities to be developed, in accordance with political priorities. These activities will subsequently influence the human resources and finances to be allocated.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that adopting this method will make it easier to carry out a thorough assessment of the consequences of particular policies and actions.</p>
<p class="contents">In spite of the efforts that have already been made, I am compelled to note the poor quality of the activity statements and their lack of usefulness to the budgetary process. They fall well short of the desired level. Information is dispersed, not quantified and often lacking in practical detail. Most of the targets and their respective indicators are not measurable, and their implications for human and financial resources are scarcely explained.</p>
<p class="contents">The key aim of the exercise has not been achieved. Given that anything that is not measured cannot be managed, there is still no clear link between the objectives and targets, on the one hand, and the indicators chosen to gauge the degree to which those objectives have been met, on the other.</p>

<p class="contents">I feel that following the political changes that took place at the end of 2000 in Serbia and Montenegro (SCG, formerly the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia), the authorities in the country have achieved notable success in terms of economic and stabilisation reforms. It is crucial that the EU continue to support all moves towards peace and stability in the region. These countries have achieved good results in terms of stability and Commission missions in the area have noted positive developments.</p>
<p class="contents">Macroeconomic stability has been achieved and sustained, and important structural reforms have been set in motion. Progress has been made in privatising socially-owned companies, which has taken place on the basis of auctions and tenders, and the restructuring of the industrial and financial sectors has got underway. The programme of economic reforms has received additional support through Community macrofinancial packages, which have been awarded on the basis of compliance with agreed conditions on economic and structural policy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">It should be pointed out that Serbia has suffered acutely from instability arising from the aftermath of war and from the reduction in the area that it covers.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation was made significantly worse by the barbaric murder of Prime Minister Zoran Djindjic in March last year, which inevitably held back the reforms that had until then been moving at a promising pace and that the new government has been seeking to resume.</p>
<p class="contents">The delays that have taken place have prevented the third instalment of the additional aid from being awarded according to the timetable set out in Directive 2002/882/EC.

In view of the technical complexity of this issue and the doubts that are still being raised among the scientific community, we have an obligation to be on maximum alert. This motion for a resolution puts this obligation into practice and is, indeed, a further illustration of our citizens’ real interests and concerns, namely the highest possible level of public health protection.

Because of this, India is considered by some as a kind of EU for South Asia and also as a buffer against the mistrusted Islamic world. Part of this Parliament therefore wants to bring about an alliance and close, mutually beneficial economic cooperation, without further attention being paid to the major problems that remain unresolved as regards human rights and the threat of war. Indian society is still – contrary to current legislation – divided into castes, with some 150 million people being outcastes and thus considered by others as untouchables. Mainly in rural areas, they remain condemned to the dirtiest and worst paid jobs. Previous governments, based on Hindu nationalism, abandoned efforts to combat discrimination against them. They have also failed to resolve the issue of Kashmir, where the majority of the population is Muslim and has seen itself as under occupation for over half a century. Nor have other minorities seen their problems resolved. I denounce the emphasis that the EU is currently placing on commercial interests at the expense of peaceful coexistence and human rights.

One third of the population sees itself as a border territory on Russia west, sharing with it a language, culture and religion. Being on the connection routes with the EU countries, they regard their area as more important than other parts of Russia. They see their current President, Lukashenko, as guaranteeing stability and minimum living conditions amidst the confusion of their neighbouring countries. Another third of the population sees Belarus as a state with its own language and culture, a buffer state between Poland and Russia, and as capable of joining the EU. Supporters of this approach are meeting with the utmost opposition from the present regime, which sabotages organisations, newspapers, protests, minority religions, education in their own language and opposition parties’ election campaigns in every way it can, and those who fall victim to this see their country as a dictatorship. Between those two opinions, there is another group without any strong views, which offers no resistance. Lukashenko wants to remain in power and, alongside Putin, play an important role in a Greater Russia. As it is only by oppressing others that he can do this, it is justified that plans, developed in Poland and Lithuania, for radio programmes and education, organised from abroad, in Belarussian should receive support from the whole of the EU. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Personally, I would prefer to see a ban on cluster bombs, but the cluster munitions coalition, which comprises a reasonably large group of NGOs and probably has a realistic idea of the state of play with regard to negotiations about a protocol at international level, has argued in favour of a temporary moratorium because that appears to be the most likely course of action. In the final analysis, as we have seen over the past few days, that is what politics is about, namely the threat to create a real power base by means of a majority. Needless to say, if this is to succeed –and here we can count on the broad support of this Parliament – it does require commitment on the part of the Council, the Commission and the Member States. We need a new protocol that addresses all the humanitarian problems associated with cluster munitions, such as have once again been raised quite specifically during a hearing of the Committee on Development. We have seen how a good deal of those munitions end up in precisely the world’s poorest countries, from Afghanistan to the Falkland Islands, and also closer to home, in Serbia and Montenegro. To this day, 78 countries have some 400 million anti-personnel mines and anti-vehicle mines in stock, which demonstrates that a vast quantity is still available even in our Fifteen Member States; indeed, they are still being manufactured in ten of them. It is obvious that international agreements are the only means left of tackling this. We need a protocol, so tough and intensive negotiations are required, and this is where Europe can speak with one voice. Speaking with one voice is something of which we are very much in favour. The Red Cross and the UN are on our side. Actually, this is where I would like to ask the Members belonging to the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to take a step closer to us. I cannot imagine that we do not have any common ground here; we may well not have any where Mr Buttiglione is concerned, but on cluster bombs we should be able to see eye to eye. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

When launched, a bomb of this kind can disintegrate into anything up to 8 000 bomblets, which then lie spread across areas of up to 240 000 square metres – about 50 football pitches – and work in much the same way as land mines, threatening civilians, children and women just as much as military personnel. This is clearly in breach of Article 51 of the First Additional Protocol to the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">For that reason, 18 months ago, on 10 February 2003, the European Parliament called for a moratorium on the manufacture and use of such cluster munitions and cluster bombs, and for them to be banned outright in the long term. This makes it a political scandal that these weapons are still being produced in the European Union – in Germany, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Belgium. So what we are doing is adopting a pious resolution to the effect that this sort of thing is a violation of human rights and has to stop, and then we go on producing the things. At national level, our governments are doing nothing about this. That is hypocrisy, and that is why it is absolutely necessary that this House should again make its voice heard in opposition to the production of such weapons in the European Union and against the trade in them.</p>
<p class="contents">It is perverse thinking for the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats to acknowledge, in item 1 of their resolution, the devastating effects of these weapons, and then, in item 3, to express understanding for the military use of them, on the grounds that the armed forces would otherwise deploy even worse weaponry. I think the ethical stance of the Christian members of the conservative group must make such a position untenable, so I call upon them to withdraw this item from their resolution; it really does undermine the case. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This cause is essential, I believe, in promoting a culture that can help to prevent and resolve the problems that man brings upon himself in an endless succession of suffering, injuries and deaths, which all too often affect the civilian population and which are caused by the laying of landmines in many countries. Mines are deadly weapons of war that we must oppose at all costs, since they are directed against the civilian population, remain active indefinitely and often make it impossible to implement effective mine-clearing operations.</p>
<p class="contents">We know that the international community has taken action on these issues. Non-governmental organisations have mounted a major campaign, backed by a collection of signatures, and have launched a spontaneous movement which has led the governments of many countries to sign the Ottawa Treaty. This is a major international treaty which has banned anti-personnel mines.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we must move on from that treaty, we must encourage a swell of opinion and then, I hope, action by governments who can draw up further conventions, legal instruments and protocols with a view to banning other types of mine. I am referring to cluster munitions, extremely deadly mines whose devastating effect is many times greater than that of anti-personnel mines.</p>
<p class="contents">Anyone who has had the chance to see the exhibits on display in some museum of horror, if I can use that turn of phrase, cannot help but feel indignation and a strong impulse to take action on this issue. We have recently been to Slovenia, and were able to see in a museum the effects of this kind of mine.</p>
<p class="contents">We saw photos, pictures of fields, pictures of wounded people. We met people who bear in their flesh the effects of these weapons, which the international community must ban. They are not traditional tools of war, precisely because they are not confined to the battlefields and will strike civilian populations, women and children. They strike the children who play in the fields, the women who go into the cultivated fields to gather their food, where instead they encounter death.</p>
<p class="contents">I hope that this Parliament will undertake to broaden the existing convention to include this other type of deadly weapon. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

A fervent appeal to the rules of international law is the way to find refuge from barbarity and the law of the jungle.</p>
<p class="contents">The appeal contained in the joint resolution, which we will vote on today, brings in this line of defence and calls for a moratorium as well as an undertaking to abolish the use, production, storage and exporting of cluster munitions. These munitions pose a danger to the civilian population. Women, children, the old, men, whom I have seen with lacerated flesh and amputated limbs – in Kabul, in Kandahar, in Pristina – in the clinics where they are trying to save what can be saved. This is barbarity, since these mines are used by our democratic countries.</p>
<p class="contents">US aircraft dropped thousands of cluster bombs on Afghanistan and Iraq. On the outskirts of Kabul I saw those yellow objects that attract children and are the same colour as food rations, which always used to arrive in the villages from the sky.</p>
<p class="contents">There are at least 57 countries holding stocks of cluster munitions, 22 of which are in Europe. There is no doubt that this is in breach of international law. We have to ensure that the safeguarding of human rights prevails over military interests: the right to life for millions of people. This is a goal which we have to set ourselves. For the European Parliament this has to be a commitment, as was the case for the ratification of the Ottawa Mine Ban Treaty, thanks to the unceasing work of thousands of people in non-governmental organisations.</p>
<p class="contents">In Europe, we still have to convince Poland, Finland and Latvia to sign up to it. We must also negotiate a new protocol to the convention on conventional weapons and, at the conference to review the Ottawa Treaty, encourage a consensus among states to ban anti-tank mines with sensitive fuses, which explode on human contact. A resolution is not enough; we cannot stop there, and that is why we have also asked for permanent monitoring by the European Parliament. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Our armed forces have fully supported this work. Their judgment, which we share, is that cluster munitions and anti-tank mines should not be regarded in the same way as anti-personnel landmines. At this time, our armed forces need to retain the unique capabilities of these weapons in their armouries. Indeed, military authorities estimate that if cluster munitions were banned, disproportionately powerful munitions would be required to achieve the same effect. Such weapons might pose a greater risk to civilians during conflict and would increase the levels of devastation caused.</p>
<p class="contents">In regard to the post-conflict effects of cluster munitions and anti-tank mines, much progress has been made in Geneva on dealing with the explosive remnants of war. Work continues to improve the technical aspects of certain weapons so that they do not continue to be a threat to local civilians after a conflict has ended. These initiatives are spearheaded by a group of governmental experts who are mindful of the need for the right balance between humanitarian concerns and military utility.</p>
<p class="contents">Regarding certain weapons, it is well understood that the armed forces of our nations, and those of NATO allies, are the most conscious of the need to protect our civilian populations, avoid collateral damage and ensure that dangers to our own troops are minimised.</p>
<p class="contents">The motion before this House, tabled by the Left, fails to take into account such considerations and is factually incorrect. Its provisions are unrealistic and, consequently, it would not be helpful in tackling the problems caused by explosive remnants of war.</p>
<p class="contents">On a positive note, I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate the Commission and the Member States on the support they have provided for global mine action against anti-personnel landmines, mine clearance and assistance to victims. I would encourage them to focus their efforts to end this threat to civilian populations from the explosive remnants of war and anti-personnel landmines by 2010 at the latest, and not be sidetracked by other issues.</p>

We have in fact decided that our members will have a free vote, and I am very definitely among those who intend to support this resolution when it comes to be voted on.</p>
<p class="contents">I thought it interesting that Mr van den Berg should mention the name of Buttiglione. Mr Buttiglione and I were among those Christian Democrats who were forthrightly critical of the Iraq war, and of the use of cluster munitions in it, from the very outset, and so I find it regrettable that Mr Buttiglione’s presence in the Commission has been thought undesirable. He would be a very good ally to have on this issue.</p>
<p class="contents">The second point I want to make is that Mr Schmidt appealed to our Christian convictions. This he has said – and let me say this loud and clear – at the end of a week when we in this House have been told time and time again that policy must not be influenced by religious convictions. I disagree with that, and my Christian convictions lead me to believe that everything possible must indeed be done to deal not only with anti-personnel mines of every kind, but also with cluster munitions, which really do present an extreme danger to the civilian population, and particularly to children. Let us not, however, apply double standards. People’s Christian convictions can lead them to adopt quite divergent political positions, but they should in any case respect each other’s. I personally take the view – as I believe does the majority in my group – that we should implement this moratorium, which makes sense and is necessary, and I can only say that we should very definitely make an issue of the use of cluster munitions in Chechnya, as Russia is a member state of the Council of Europe, which sits here in Strasbourg. Although Chechnya, if one regards it – as many do, although I do not – as part of Russia, can therefore be said to be Council of Europe territory and thus subject to the Convention on Human Rights, cluster munitions are deployed directly against the civilian population. The same, though, is true of Iraq, just as it was true of the Balkans. As we cannot be narrow-minded about this, let me say that I very much support this resolution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I would therefore prefer to express my support for the text of the resolution – which takes up the majority of our suggestions – and express my full agreement with what my colleague, Mr van den Berg, has said, and I will not mention the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats asking us to vote one way or another, since I believe our positions identify who we are and I believe that, on issues such as this, it is very good that we can see exactly who everybody is so that public opinion and the organisations can differentiate between us.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add two comments. Firstly, I would like to draw attention to the fact that, unlike antipersonnel mines, the manufacture of cluster bombs requires very complex technology, a technology which is only within reach of the highly industrialised countries, and that means the responsibilities of the Member States of the Union are under scrutiny.</p>
<p class="contents">Furthermore, however, a very sophisticated air or land infrastructure is essential in order to launch these bombs, as well as specific knowledge for the military personnel capable of firing them. And some of our countries clearly have a role here as well, both in terms of logistical preparation and in the training of military personnel.</p>
<p class="contents">In the hearing we held – which was magnificent – I was disappointed that we found it rather difficult to name those countries of the world, whether European or not, who are producing the weapons we are condemning here. I would also have thought it relevant to name those countries and their corresponding responsibilities in our resolution. And that leads me to my second comment, which is to insist that the European Parliament must commit itself to sparing no effort to ensure that what we approve today does not remain mere words.</p>
<p class="contents">There are concrete proposals suggested to us by the organisations, who must continue to be our permanent interlocutor in this fight. For example, we are very interested in the idea of designating a rapporteur to monitor, on behalf of the European Parliament, what is being done in our countries and internationally with regard to eliminating cluster bombs. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

In Germany, this war was supported by all the political groupings apart from the PDS, particularly by the Social Democrats and the Greens, and the consequences are still tangible. It is reported that between 30 000 and 50 000 stray cluster bombs are still to this day contaminating whole tracts of land in Kosovo.</p>
<p class="contents">We have to speak plainly here: most of the firms making profits from cluster bombs are European, the German firm of Rheinmetall being one example. It is evident that large-scale bombardments with cluster bombs are regarded as part of waging war. The Americans and the British used 13 000 such projectiles in their war on Iraq, and so the only right response is an outright ban on cluster bombs. If we are to have that, we must be outspoken in our criticism of the weapons industry and of the armed forces that use these weapons. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I believe that our resolution today helps to foster such awareness and to precipitate such action.</p>
<p class="contents">This text criticises the continuing and frequent deployment of cluster munitions in armed conflict. Not only does it claim victims while hostilities are in progress, but also for years afterwards, a problem underlined in Human Rights Watch’s report on the conduct of the Iraq war and its civilian victims, which was published at the end of 2003.</p>
<p class="contents">In it, we read that the use of large quantities of cluster munitions, particularly by American and British ground troops, claimed the lives of hundreds of civilians. I do not believe that much is to be gained by affirmations of a desire to make such weaponry safer and to produce it in such a way that its effects on the civilian population are less devastating. It follows that this House’s call for an immediate moratorium on the production and use of cluster bombs is extraordinarily important. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are also concerned about the particular difficulties involved in clearing areas contaminated by this specific type of active munitions. As you are aware, the European Union has always been an ardent supporter of the Protocol on Explosive Remnants of War to the United Nations Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional Weapons. We now need all of the Member States to ratify this protocol so that it can enter into force as soon as possible, which, as you know, is not yet the case.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the Commission is concerned, we are doing our best to solve the problems posed by cluster munitions by working in two main areas. The first that I will mention is mine clearance operations. These operations, like our initiatives to raise awareness of the risks and help victims, are carried out by virtue of Community instruments, in particular the Parliament and the Council regulation on anti-personnel landmines, and in practice often involve the removal of other unexploded ordnance. This is what we are doing in Laos, Cambodia, Kosovo, Afghanistan and Iraq, to mention just a few countries. These efforts are clearly far from adequate. Although this debate gives me the opportunity, on behalf of the Commission, to thank Parliament for its unstinting support for the regulation on anti-personnel landmines, I must nevertheless remind you that the budget for mine clearance and hiring experts in this field is not enough to tackle the problems posed by all of the explosives that still need to be made safe, including cluster munitions and anti-vehicle mines. From the point of view of the Commission, the priority remains achieving the objectives set out in the Convention on the Prohibition of Anti-Personnel Mines, with its deadline of 2010.</p>
<p class="contents">The second aspect of our work has just been launched: it is to implement the pilot project on small arms and explosive remnants of war. Here too, I should like to thank Parliament for making it possible for the Commission to examine closely all of the issues and problems associated with both the explosive remnants of war and the dissemination of small arms. This pilot project should enable the Commission to propose measures that will give the Union a level of expertise, knowledge and authority in the field of small arms and the explosive remnants of war that is comparable with what it has acquired thanks to the regulation on anti-personnel mines.</p>
<p class="contents">Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, you have heard the Commission’s reaction. We will collaborate with all of the stakeholders to guarantee that an integrated and comprehensive humanitarian approach is adopted to all of the problems posed by what we by convention call the remnants of war, but which it would perhaps be more appropriate to call the trash of war. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p class="contents">We in Europe regard Iran as a great country. Its deeply rooted culture – and I would even go so far as to say at times its genius – is reflected in its art, its literature and in the strident voice of its civil society. It is a great country that Europe respects.</p>
<p class="contents">Today, on the basis of these indicators, Iran is in poor health. A year ago, a few of us visited Iran and hoped, at election time, that the reformers that had been struck off the list of candidates would be reinstated. We were cruelly disappointed. Today, many of us hope that the women of Iran will regain the freedom to wear what they want, the freedom to laugh, the freedom to listen to music and the freedom to hold an opinion and, for example, to hold office as judges. But this is almost a detail.</p>
<p class="contents">Today we are concerned – and this urgent motion for a resolution proves it – for three reasons. Today, minors are being sentenced to death in Iran and one, Ateqeh Rajabi, aged 16, has been hanged. Freedom of expression of the press or on the Internet no longer exists. The motion includes the names of journalists who have been arrested, among them Omid Memarian, whom I had personally invited to visit the European Parliament in November. Stonings continue to take place despite the moratorium on stoning which I am still waiting to evolve into real legislation, and the dialogue between the European Union and Iran on human rights has not yet advanced beyond words.</p>
<p class="contents">Out of respect for this great country, I would like this situation to change. For the last two days, since tabling this motion, I have been inundated with letters from the Iranian Embassy saying, ‘No, your sources are not reliable, none of this is happening’. Iran should prove that, ‘none of this is happening’ and thus remain a partner which, in terms of both human rights and politics, we in the European Union can continue to value. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Iran leads the international rogues’ gallery when it comes to executions. They are leaders with little to recommend them. This House always condemns executions, wherever they take place. We shall continue to do so, especially where minors are concerned. Execution is completely unacceptable and contravenes all the international conventions.</p>
<p class="contents">The Iranian Government has recently intensified its hounding of journalists and dissidents. Quite a few journalists have disappeared or have been imprisoned, tortured and killed. We must vigorously condemn this development and demand that those who are still alive be released, or that their families be informed.</p>
<p class="contents">The so-called human rights dialogue that we have been conducting with Iran for quite a few years has failed, and we must recognise the fact. It must either be concluded or be considerably redefined. Has it produced any results? No, we cannot point to any progress. We owe the Iranian people a strong EU commitment in Iran to democracy and human rights. If there is no progress in this area, it is, in the view of myself and of the Group of the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, quite impossible to imagine any kind of association agreement with Iran. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This debate has been prompted by deep concern at the deterioration of the situation, a concern echoed by the Council in October.</p>
<p class="contents">It would appear that the increasing number of reports of death sentences being imposed is only the tip of the iceberg. Scarcely any opportunities remain for us to really monitor what is happening. Four months after the parliamentary elections in Iran, we are faced with a situation in which a deliberate clampdown is being implemented against the small freedoms won and the progress achieved over recent years, such as freedom of movement for women, journalists, pupils and students, and in which the Iranian parliament systematically rejects government bills seeking to improve the rule of law, such as those relating to gender equality.</p>
<p class="contents">In this context, I should like to stress that announcements of expected improvements – and we have received a great many letters from Iran’s Ambassador to Brussels too – are not enough on their own. It is true that all progress, no matter how small, towards improving the human rights situation for those affected and those in danger is to be welcomed, but, to be quite frank, I must say that I find it far from satisfactory for a government bill on the suspension of stonings merely to be announced.</p>
<p class="contents">We must fight to ensure that stonings are not merely suspended but actually outlawed. In my opinion, statements that the Iranian Parliament, the Majlis, has been presented with a bill on suspending the death sentence for juveniles do not go far enough. After all, this means that in general the death sentence will continue to be legitimate and legal, and that cannot be the position adopted by this House. In this case as well, therefore, we welcome progress, but as yet this progress hardly corresponds to our ideas of democracy and the rule of law.</p>
<p class="contents">This parliamentary term has seen the European Parliament, for the first time in its history, set up an interparliamentary delegation for relations with the Islamic Republic of Iran. Despite the deterioration in the human rights situation, or rather precisely because of it, we have set up and supported this delegation. We in this House seek to make use of the few instruments available to us to provide help and to build contacts with the Iranian parliament. The Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance has assumed the chairmanship of this delegation, and despite all the problems I look forward to the cooperation between this House and the Majlis. We must endeavour to move dialogue forward so that those who fight as democrats in Iran hear a strong voice of support from Europe. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This was made easier by the fact that Iran had a reform-minded Parliament throughout that period, we were initially able to establish good contacts with it.</p>
<p class="contents">Over the years, however, there have been moves not only to deprive the public systematically of the small freedoms that have just been mentioned, but also to bring pressure to bear even on members of the parliament, especially those from the judiciary and from the conservative sections of the clergy. As a result of this, unfortunately, this year has seen an increase in the number of reports of death sentences being carried out, including those imposed on juveniles, such as the 16-year-old girl who was hanged in August. It is of course out of the question for us to accept such a state of affairs.</p>
<p class="contents">It is therefore right and proper that there should be at present no plans for a Partnership and Cooperation Agreement. If we are to be able to make a contribution, our Delegation for relations with Iran needs to attempt to make contact not merely with the parliament, but also with civil society. It is important that we should show those in Iran who want change – and there are many of them – that we are not merely observing them, but that we are also attempting to build contacts, as by doing so we will give them the courage to try to improve conditions from the inside. I agree that we should not take interventionist action from the outside, but that we should instead strengthen the forces which exist within Iran itself, so that they can build their own democracy. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Although the aggressive and ultra-conservative Iranian Government is supported by only a minority of the population, it has little reason to worry about Europe’s solidarity with the Iranian people. The justified condemnations from Europe are overtaken by a practice of a completely different nature. Last week, the French press office AFP reported that the EU’s three largest Member States have forged a mutually advantageous agreement with Iran. In exchange for a restriction on Iranian developments in the area of atomic energy and possibly nuclear weapons, the Iranian democratic opposition in exile would remain on the list of terrorist organisations. In no way do we have a problem with these exiles, but the Iranian regime does. Applying the designation of ‘terrorist’ to organisations should not be something to be bartered with. While the neighbouring countries Iraq and Afghanistan are handled extremely roughly, why is everyone acting as if this government in Iran has eternal life? </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I think that this is one of our duties, one of our principal goals. Therefore, I consider it our duty to take a particular interest in those areas where there is the greatest risk of the most fundamental human rights not being respected. Iran is certainly one of these areas and we must therefore consider our commitment to this country to be an absolute priority.</p>
<p class="contents">I would like to add, however, that recent reports have on more than one occasion proved to be totally contradictory. This leaves us with a picture of the current situation without any definite certainties. I say ‘definite certainties’, because we certainly have some idea already.</p>
<p class="contents">In these last few days, the Iranian authorities have stated that the information in our documents does not correspond to the truth. On this point, naturally, I cannot be in total agreement, but it seems likely that a few inaccuracies have been included. I certainly do not believe that we should take what the Iranian authorities say as the gospel truth, as we know that in the past, and perhaps now too, this country has certainly not distinguished itself for its transparency and democracy.</p>
<p class="contents">I believe, however, although this is perhaps not complying precisely with the rules of this Chamber, that it would now be wise to propose a postponement of the vote on this resolution. We should delay voting to another part-session, obviously not very far in the future, when we have succeeded in obtaining rather more accurate data. I do not intend, moreover, to call into question everything said by the Iranian embassy. In fact, the Iranian embassy sent a letter to our President Mr Borrell yesterday – I have a copy of it – following up on correspondence with Mrs Svensson, in which it contests the content of our resolutions.</p>
<p class="contents">I had thought that it was still not clear whether the death penalty was still inflicted on minors in Iran. According to the Iranian authorities, though, it would seem that in the last two years all capital punishment of minors has been suspended. In view of this, therefore, I propose that the vote be postponed to a later date, and that meanwhile we listen again to the Iranian authorities in order to have a more precise picture and to be able to reflect on our vote more calmly and collectedly. In any case, if we proceed to a vote, the UEN Group will obviously vote in favour of this resolution, while I will abstain in the light of what I have just said. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

Throughout history Iran, or Persia, has always been one of the most important countries in the global region in which it is situated. This will remain the case in future, and the country is of tremendous importance, particularly for Europe.</p>
<p class="contents">It is precisely for this reason, however, that we must push for human rights to be monitored closely, as long-term stability can only be achieved on the basis of human rights, not at the cost of such rights. I must therefore object most strongly to Mr La Russa’s proposal, as if this House were to postpone human rights resolutions every time it received a letter from an embassy, it would make no progress whatsoever with its work in this field. We will, of course, maintain dialogue with Iran; since Iranian diplomats already appear to be following our moves so closely, however, I can tell them right now, as part of this debate, that they should inform the judiciary, politicians and administration of their country that this House has frequently discussed human rights violations in the past. This was followed by regime change, with those who committed these violations of human rights and repressions bitterly regretting having chosen the wrong side.</p>
<p class="contents">For many years, we held intense debates criticising the Iron Curtain and the regime behind it, as well as denouncing human rights violations. Today many of those who suppressed human rights during this time would be glad to have not done so or to be able to undo their actions.</p>
<p class="contents">We must therefore continue to focus a spotlight on events, as the only protection we can offer victims of persecution is that we will hold debates on issues, that we will face facts, and that we will bring these facts to the public’s attention. We must, of course, take the utmost care in doing so, which is always difficult when too many names are mentioned. The massive scale on which human rights are violated in Iran and the suppression of the freedom of the press, as well as the continued inclusion of the death penalty in the Penal Code, and – although they are perhaps not carried out today – the legal status accorded to stonings and the failure to prohibit them, as rightly noted; these are facts, and from them we cannot turn away. I therefore recommend that this resolution be adopted. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I am replying to the last speaker but one from the other side. In August and September 1988, thousands of progressive patriots, communists, trade unionists and democrats, including 38 leading cadres of the Tudeh Party of Iran, were executed, brutally tortured or imprisoned. There was, of course, no such consideration for them at that time.</p>
<p class="contents">The situation is truly intolerable. We express our solidarity with the people of Iran. We believe that the people themselves must bring down this regime. We also support the request submitted to the UN by the families of the victims of the 1988 slaughter for information about the fate of their relatives who disappeared. Nonetheless, I would point out that we face a new Iraq-type plan announced by the United States of America, which named Iran as one of the countries of the axis of evil. This plan has been adopted by ΝΑΤΟ, integrated into the general 'Middle East' plan agreed at the ΝΑΤΟ summit in Istanbul last June and accepted by the European Union. These forces are endeavouring, using as a pretext human rights, which are indeed dishonoured in Iran, or the production of nuclear weapons by Iran, to secure the consent or tolerance of the people to the unleashing of new wars, not for human rights, but in order to control the region and its oil.</p>
<p class="contents">This time, we warn you, the people will not fall into the trap. All of you dreaming of a new Iraq will be sorely disappointed, because the whole of mankind will rise up. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This is also a debate in which it must be stated quite clearly that two things must never be forgotten if we are to bring progress to other countries outside the EU. Firstly, equal opportunities and equality before the law must be implemented in the EU itself, where much remains to be done, to put it mildly. Only then will we have the moral right to reprimand others. Secondly, as the doctor’s creed says, ‘first do no harm’.</p>
<p class="contents">It is not difficult to adopt a resolution, but it is difficult to dispute facts that are unacceptable in terms of the European system of values we claim as our own. It should not be forgotten that the European system of values and the system of values that exists in Iran – a system of values bound up with the country’s religion – are two quite disparate worlds. Any attempt at taking short cuts in rebuilding this system may lead to unrest, with a legitimate goal proving to be the cause of even greater tragedies for the Iranian people. I am sure the House is full of good intentions, but we will not be able to make genuine improvements to the lives of the Iranian people by issuing condemnations or imposing isolation of any kind. The only way to achieve progress is through gradual development, and any attempts to cut short this process cannot fail to result in tension and a further closing off of the country’s system and regime. Any real influence we have on events inside Iran is extremely limited.</p>
<p class="contents">Whilst on the subject of human rights, it is worth taking this opportunity to present the other side of the story, which has had an impact right here at the heart of Europe. The system of values upon which European civilisation was built, and upon which European and Latin cultures were built, is now being rejected by this very House. This is also a short cut. It means all the nations and all the Member States of the European Union are still being forced to accept models imposed by a minority as the only politically correct ones. This is another approach that cannot fail to result in tension if unnecessary short cuts are taken, and this tension may be one of the key reasons why the European Union is unable to create a genuinely firm foundation for the edifice you wish to construct. In conclusion, therefore, I should like to warn against condemning and admonishing others as long as we remain incapable of putting our own backyard in order. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We are discussing a country that is finishing work on an atomic bomb and on devices able to launch such bombs at Israel and at American bases. This poses the threat of supraregional conflict.</p>
<p class="contents">What image do we have of Iran today? One made up of a whole variety of aspects, such as the sentencing to death of teenagers, as referred to by previous speakers, public executions and stonings. This is not a matter of a European system of values, Mr Pęk, it is a matter of indisputable human values. We hear of executions on a daily basis, as if we were reading reports of road accidents in Europe. The figures are as follows: 22 executions were carried out in October, and 120 over the course of six months. These figures hide human tragedies that statistics may not fully reveal, and the situation is deteriorating, as those who favour a tough line increasingly have the say in Iran.</p>
<p class="contents">We should not allow a debate on persecution to pass without reference to an issue which has not yet been raised before this House. To my great surprise, Mr Pęk did not mention it either. I have in mind the persecution of religious minorities and of Christians. For example, 80 Christians were arrested in Teheran on 11 September. It is a shame that this escaped Mr Pęk’s attention. The situation we are discussing is a kind of never-ending story that just goes on and on. This being the case, Mr Meijer is entirely right to say that the inclusion of certain bodies, for example the People’s Mujahideen, in the list of terrorist organisations would be a mistake, as these are the very people who are fighting against the regime. The European Parliament must bring pressure to bear on Iran, and I should like to praise those Members of this House who lead the way on this issue and monitor developments in the field. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

These conclusions are unequivocal: despite the commitment made by the Iranian Government to reinforce human rights and to promote the rule of law, very little progress has been made. That is, moreover, the reason why the Union decided in principle in September to co-sponsor the resolution on the human rights situation in Iran that Canada intends to table at the United Nations General Assembly.</p>
<p class="contents">Nevertheless, we believe that it is crucial – and I am sure that most of the Members here today would agree – to continue our efforts to establish a constructive and long-term relationship between the European Union and Iran. Seen in this light, the dialogue with Iran is an important tool for encouraging the democratic process, and we are determined to pursue this dialogue, which was initiated in December 2002 to consider in particular human rights. It is a useful tool for making contacts, not only with influential representatives of the judiciary, but also with representatives of Iranian civil society. I should like furthermore to underline the visits that the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on human rights have made to Iran since this dialogue began.</p>
<p class="contents">I clearly heard Mrs De Keyser’s comment that this dialogue amounted only to words. I heard Mrs Malmström suggest that we should, as it were, draw it to a close. This is not our position, not because of the extent of the results achieved at this stage – such results can only be assessed in the long term – but rather because of an absence of viable alternatives. We have also entered into discussions with Iran on economic and trade issues and held a number of negotiating sessions in the hope of reaching a trade and cooperation agreement. Nevertheless, in the light of increasing concern, particularly about nuclear matters, these discussions have been suspended for some time. I think that answers Mr Gahler’s suggestion.</p>
<p class="contents">As you are aware, the issue of the development of the Iranian nuclear programme continues to be dealt with at international level. In parallel, the Union has given its blessing to the negotiations currently being conducted in Vienna by the United Kingdom, France and Germany on the idea of a nuclear package. The Council of Ministers is obviously better placed than we are to report on this, if required, and also to respond to Mr Casaca’s point on the MKO, since the list in question is drawn up on the initiative of the Member States by the Council itself and the Commission does not make proposals in this field.</p>
<p class="contents">I will finish, Mr President, by saying, on behalf of the Commission, that the Iranians are perfectly aware of the fact that all of the political, nuclear, trade and human rights issues that we have just debated are inextricably linked and that, broadly speaking, we are in favour of constructive engagement, but that on no account does this mean granting Iran a kind of <span class="italic">carte blanche</span> enabling it to act irresponsibly in the areas that are giving your Parliament, the Commission and, I am sure, the Council serious cause for concern. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

We reiterate two underlying commitments against which these concerns must be evaluated. Firstly, one of the prime duties of democracies is to protect their citizens with resolve and to fight terrorism firmly and tenaciously. Secondly, both the EU and the United States have to ensure the right to freedom, democracy, the rule of law and human rights. If either of us fights a war on terror in a way that breaches these fundamental principles, the terrorists have won. Consequently, this Parliament demands that both EU and non-EU prisoners at Guantanamo Bay – including five of my London constituents – be tried, without delay, in a fair and public hearing and by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal – not by military commissions.</p>
<p class="contents">The US Supreme Court has said that the protection provided under the US constitution applies, but the present Administration is frustrating implementation of that judgment. What real action is the EU taking to convince the US in its – and our – own interest to obey the rule of law? Would this not be easier if the UK was not also holding prisoners without charge or trial?</p>
<p class="contents">With regard to the well-documented harsh and coercive treatment at Guantanamo Bay, Abu Graib and elsewhere, what is happening to morality as well as legality? Some, including me, would say that torture is taking place. Internees at Belmarsh in England are literally being driven mad by indefinite incarceration. The former UK ambassador to Uzbekistan has highlighted how reliance is being place on torture-induced evidence. Are these the standards that we wish to accept? I look forward to hearing how the EU is acting forcefully to stop this moral and legal rot.</p>

<p class="contents">This is not our first resolution on the subject and we have made some progress since the first one we approved in February 2002. That first text began with a macabre irony, reiterating the European Parliament’s firm solidarity with the United States in the fight against terrorism, with full respect for the rights and freedoms of the individual. Of course at that time it was all to justify American actions by blaming what was happening in Guantánamo on a lack of definitions and the need to update the Geneva Convention.</p>
<p class="contents">Looking back two and a half years later, that Resolution was a scandal. Fortunately, two years later, we adopted the Andreasen report’s Recommendation to the Council, which was much more appropriate.</p>
<p class="contents">The text proposed to us today may be politically correct, although it seems to me to be excessively sterile. We are still treating with kid gloves what is a radical denial of the rule of law and respect for the rules established by the international community for maintaining peace, and, above all, we fail to say that what we called for seven months ago has received nothing more than disdain and silence from the United States.</p>
<p class="contents">The aim of my speech is, therefore, to condemn the crime being committed in Guantánamo, and also to condemn the hypocrisy and double standards of many bodies of the European Union, including the European Parliament, when demands are being made and dialogue blocked with the country in which Guantánamo is an enclave and, at the same time, it is stated that together with the United States we form the same community of values.</p>
<p class="contents">This folly is demonstrated by what is happening in Guantánamo and if that is the community of values we share, you can count me out. My community of values, the community of values I fought for in Spain under 40 years of dictatorship promoted and sustained by Washington, is something else. It is a different community of values, which many of us believe in: quite simply the one enshrined in the European Constitution. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

On the one hand, we are aware of the threat posed by terrorism at the moment, of the horrors of global terrorism, of the challenges that it presents and the fact that, as I have often said, it is the greatest current threat to human rights and to fundamental rights. We express again our solidarity with the victims of the appalling terrorist attacks of 11 September and of 11 March this year in Madrid.</p>
<p class="contents">We are aware that it is the main duty of democracies to combat terrorism and to dismantle its networks. On the other hand, we cannot contradict the very values that we seek to uphold and that we affirm. We must be able to show that we uphold these values at all times, particularly on the front line in this battle. We therefore deplore and condemn the cases of maltreatment and inhumanity in the treatment of prisoners, as referred to just now.</p>
<p class="contents">We regret the fact that we must vote in favour of this resolution but, given the testimonies that have come to light, we have no alternative, because we must always show consistency when we affirm our values and rights. We are indeed convinced that this is also the guiding principle of the North American culture to which so many ties bind us. We accept the decisions and recommendations made by the Supreme Court and, in reference to the article published in the New York Times, we should like to see the guidelines set out by President Bush and Secretary of State Rumsfeld followed to the letter. In that way, maltreatment will not take place, the cases that have come to light can be investigated and all prisoners can be given a fair trial and can be treated with the values that we affirm and the fundamental rights that we defend. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

That would be the quickest way to put an end to the medieval treatment being suffered by the prisoners of war in Guantánamo.</p>
<p class="contents">That government has taken a step backwards from civilisation in favour of barbarism, through pre-emptive war. We are talking about the collateral damage resulting from pre-emptive war, such as the humiliation of prisoners of war in Guantánamo, where the Geneva Convention is not respected, where people are denied the right to a public and fair trial, to legal representation, and people are tortured. We already have the testimonies of people who have been tortured.</p>
<p class="contents">What are we Europeans waiting for? Yesterday this Parliament gave a lesson in the sensitivity of managing the protection of freedoms. So the old Europe cannot remain silent in the face of an administration responsible for the ignominy of having prisoners of war bound and gagged in truly medieval dungeons. The old Europe cannot tolerate that. We must therefore speak out clearly, and I agree with my fellow Spaniard, who has said that this resolution is important, but that it is very mild. We must speak out more loudly against the ignominy of Guantánamo. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

I deliberately say against terrorists and all kinds of terrorism, as I object to references to ‘terrorism’, which imply that this is a uniform phenomenon and suggest a mistaken view of the world. We must, however, be clear about the fact that this fight can only be fought and won on a legal basis. So, even though both the Group of the European People’s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats and this House stood firmly behind the USA when the Taliban regime had to be overthrown and action taken against terrorists, we say a categorical ‘no’ to what is happening in Guantánamo.</p>
<p class="contents">The unfortunate fact is, Mr Meyer Pleite, that the conditions prevailing in Iran are not at all reminiscent of the Middle Ages. In the Middle Ages there was a legal system, albeit one very different to ours, whereas what prevails in Iran is utter lawlessness. We are calling for the prisoners in Guantánamo to have access to international or national courts, or at any rate to independent courts, for them to be able to receive visits freely and for them to be afforded all rights guaranteed to them under international humanitarian law. This has nothing to do with the relativisation of terrorist ambitions; it is a prerequisite for fighting terrorism effectively. The USA is one of the oldest democracies in the world, and it has brought freedom and democracy to many European countries. Without the enormous support of the USA and our alliance with it, we would never have been able to bring down the Iron Curtain, and many of the Members of this House today would not be here if the USA had not pursued a policy of democracy throughout the world. I therefore call on the United States of America to stand firmly by our side in the fight against injustice and dictatorships, but to do so on the basis of international law and human rights. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

This means that all these people were held against their will for up to two years, without being told why. They were tortured, denied access to family, friends or legal representation, and in the end they were not charged with any crime. How can any civilised democratic society not only justify but also condone this? If a country like Iran, for instance, did this to an American citizen, I am sure George Bush would be the first to condemn it.</p>

The Union’s position on this is simple and clear: moreover, it is the same position that all of you without exception have just reaffirmed in this debate. The fight against terrorism has to take second place to respect for human rights, and not the reverse.</p>
<p class="contents">As far as the situation of the approximately 550 people still being detained at Guantanamo Bay is concerned, the Commission, as such, does not have the authority to intervene on their behalf, but that does not stop us from monitoring the situation carefully. Bilaterally, the Member States have also expressed their concerns to the United States about the way in which their nationals are being treated.</p>
<p class="contents">The recent judgment of the United States Supreme Court in the Rasoul v. Bush case was an important first step towards restoring the protection of fundamental human rights. The United States Supreme Court in fact ruled that United States courts had jurisdiction to consider challenges to the legality of the detention of foreign nationals captured abroad in connection with hostilities and incarcerated at Guantanamo Bay. That being the case, it is regrettable that in the procedures begun before the military review panels, specially set up, following this ruling, to examine the status of combatant, the detainees are not permitted to be represented by lawyers.</p>
<p class="contents">The European Union has stressed that anti-terrorist measures should go hand in hand with an unconditional ban on all forms of torture and cruel, inhuman and degrading treatment. The International Pact on Civil and Political Rights admittedly allows states to derogate from certain rights in an emergency and under certain conditions, but some rights are inviolable and should be respected under all circumstances, such as the right not to be tortured and the right not to be arbitrarily detained. These obligations, which are also enshrined in the United Nations Convention Against Torture and the Geneva Conventions, have to be respected in any event.</p>
<p class="contents">In the case of those accused of being part of the Taliban or Al Qaeda, whether they are being held at Guantanamo or elsewhere, the international community should, in our view, reaffirm its full and unremitting support for the rules of international law, including humanitarian law and rules on human rights. Real progress can only be made in the fight against terrorism if we ensure that all parties respect these values. </p></td><td width="16"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Council informs the Honourable Member that various elements should be taken into account when setting a timetable for the lifting of border controls between the Member States which apply the provisions of the Schengen acquis with regard to border controls and the new Member States.</p>
<p>The Council would like to recall the provisions of the Act of Accession which foresees a two-stage implementation procedure, whereby certain provisions of the Schengen acquis, including those on external border controls, are binding and applicable from the date of accession to the European Union, whereas others, in particular those linked to the removal of checks at the internal borders are binding from the date of accession but only applicable in the new Member States once a Council decision to that effect is taken in accordance with Art. 3(2) of the Act of Accession.</p>
<p>This Decision will only be taken after having verified, in accordance with the Schengen evaluation procedures, that all necessary conditions for the application of all parts of the acquis concerned have been met in the new Member State and after having consulted the European Parliament.</p>
<p>The Schengen acquis as integrated into the framework of the European Union with the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, includes the Decision (SCH/Com-ex (98) 26 def) setting up a Committee called the Standing Committee on the evaluation and implementation of Schengen which is to evaluate Member States before they apply the Schengen acquis in full and to monitor its application where it is already fully applied.</p>
<p>This Committee has been integrated into the working structures of the Council and comprises therefore experts from all Member States and the Commission. It will assess the situation in the new Member States with regard to their capacity to apply the Schengen acquis in full. These evaluations constitute an indispensable prerequisite for preparing a Council Decision on the lifting of controls at internal borders.</p>
<p>The new Member States have to inform the Council that they are ready to be evaluated by this Committee. An important element in this respect will be the state of readiness and the implementation of the new generation SIS, called SIS II.</p>
<p>Once these evaluations have been carried out, reports will be submitted to the Council which will serve as a basis for deciding on "opening the borders" between the new Member States and the Member States applying the Schengen acquis with regard to border control. The Council would like to point out that at present two of the "old Fifteen" Member States, i.e. the United Kingdom and Ireland, are not taking part in the frontiers provisions of the Schengen acquis.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0315"></a>

<p>Dawit Isaak is a Swedish citizen who has been imprisoned without trial in Asmara, Eritrea, since 23 September 2001. Dawit Isaak is one of ten journalists working for private-sector media who were arrested in Asmara in September 2001. Isaak has been in jail for three years during which time the authorities have refused to try him before a court of law. Reportedly, no charges have yet been brought against Isaak for any offence against Eritrean law. His family in Sweden have not received any news of him and do not know whether he is alive. The Eritrean authorities have categorically refused to comment on the case.</p>

<p>(EN) The Council shares the concern about the situation of Dawit Isaak and the other journalists who were arrested in September 2001. Since the restoration of political dialogue with Eritrea in May 2003, the EU Heads of Mission in Asmara have taken every opportunity to express their concern to the Eritrean authorities about the arbitrary detention of the group of arrested journalists and about the lack of information on their situation. Strong concerns have been expressed regarding the absence of any legal framework, rules or procedures for handling the case of these and other detainees, and EU Heads of Mission have insisted on receiving reassurances that the detainees are well treated.</p>
<p>The suspension of cooperation with Eritrea, following the opening of consultations with Eritrea under Article 96 of the Cotonou agreement and in accordance with the procedures set out in the Cotonou agreement, has not been considered. These consultations should be seen in a broader perspective as they are geared not only towards the internal political situation, but also towards other important aspects like the peace process between Eritrea and Ethiopia.</p>
<p>The Council, at the level of its preparatory bodies, has requested the EU Heads of Mission in Asmara in September to include the issue of the detained journalists in the terms of reference for the next meeting with the Eritrean Government as part of the political dialogue or to carry out a separate demarche on this issue. As no date for the next political dialogue meeting has been fixed yet, the Presidency has addressed a letter to Eritrean President Isaias on the issue. In the letter, the Presidency expresses the EU’s concern at the detention of the journalists and calls for a transparent and fair process. Furthermore, the Presidency requests the Eritrean President to allow a mission of EU Heads of Mission to visit the journalists and other political detainees.</p>
<p>The Council intends to await an answer to this letter and include this in the political dialogue and will also otherwise continue to closely follow the situation of detained journalists in Eritrea.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0316"></a>

<p>(FR) The issue of promoting and facilitating the effective integration of third country nationals in host countries is certainly one of the most important issues in the discussions currently ongoing within the EU in the field of immigration. The Dutch Presidency has therefore decided to make it one of the priorities of its work programme in the area of justice and home affairs.</p>
<p>It should be noted that there is no Community policy on this issue because, given the highly specific character of each host country - connected in particular with its history, language and culture - the issue of integration remains within the competence of the Member States. Consequently, it has been deemed preferable to address this issue by laying down a range of common principles agreed by all Member States and able to direct and guide them in defining and implementing their integration policies. Those common principles are contained in draft Council and Member State Heads of Government conclusions, which are currently being examined in Council bodies and which are due to be adopted in one of the next Council meetings.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that the Commission, for its part, has already taken measures of its own in the area of integration. In June 2003, it tabled a communication – addressed to the Council, Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions – on the subjects of immigration, integration and employment. Following that communication, the Commission set up a network of national contact points on integration which, through a series of meetings and seminars, were able to share information on the national regulations and practices regarding the subject. This information enabled the Commission to draw up an initial report on migration and integration, which was forwarded to the Council, Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions in July 2004.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Commission, with the help of the national contact points, is putting the finishing touches to a draft Good Practice Manual on integration following three conferences organised within the framework of the Integration of Third Country Nationals (INTI) programme. This manual will be presented by the Commission at the Ministerial Conference devoted to the immigration issue, which the Presidency is to hold on 9 to 11 November in Groningen.</p>
<p>It should finally be mentioned that explicit reference to integration is made in the draft Constitutional Treaty. Article III-168(4) states that ‘European laws or framework laws may establish measures to provide incentives and support for action of Member States with a view to promoting the integration of third-country nationals residing legally in their territories, excluding any harmonisation of the laws and regulations of the Member States’.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0318"></a>

<p>(EN) The European Security Strategy adopted by the European Council in December 2003 identifies effective multilateralism as the bedrock of EU foreign policy: “The development of a stronger international society, well functioning international institutions and a rule-based international order is our objective. We are committed to upholding and developing International Law. The fundamental framework for international relations is the United Nations Charter. The United Nations Security Council has the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security”.</p>
<p>In this context, conflict prevention is important: “We need to be able to act before the countries around us deteriorate, when signs of proliferation are detected, and before humanitarian emergencies arise. Preventive engagement can avoid more serious problems in the future.”</p>
<p>As the Honourable Member knows, the main objective of the EU has always been to secure peace in Europe and to prevent future wars. The Council is working hard to bring peace and stability to its neighbourhood and has adopted inter alia the European Neighbourhood Policy to that aim. The Council is not aware of any threats to launch a preventive war against a Member State.</p>
<p>In its political dialogue with third countries, the EU is actively promoting effective multilateralism and an international rule of law. The EU and Russia have a strategic partnership. They cooperate in a full range of issues, reflecting Russia's important role as a partner in Europe, direct neighbour to the EU and strategic global actor. They have undertaken a number of steps, in particular post-9/11, to deal with the new global threats, including counter-terrorism and non-proliferation. In this cooperation the EU seeks to ensure that the fundamental principles of democracy and human rights are fully respected. The Council intends to continue to engage positively with Russia on these issues.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0324"></a>

<p>(EN) The Council has, in the past months, regularly discussed the issue evoked by the Honourable Parliamentarian. The alleged development of long-range ballistic missiles by Iran is a matter of serious concern for the international community because it contributes to destabilising the region and could also constitute a potential threat to all States within the range of the missiles. Therefore, the EU Member States apply robust export controls in accordance with the regulation guiding the export of dual use goods (EC 1334/2000) in order to prevent the transfer of sensitive equipment and technology to Iran.</p>
<p>Concerning the perceived risk of an Iranian capacity to develop nuclear weapons, the EU is working in all international fora, including at the IAEA in Vienna, to increase the pressure on Iran to fully co-operate with the IAEA in its inspection activities, and to be fully transparent on its nuclear programme. In addition, the EU is working to convince Iran to suspend, as a confidence building measure, all enrichment and reprocessing activities.</p>
<p>Most recently, on the occasion of the General Affairs Council meeting of 11 October 2004, Ministers' discussion on Iran focused on the nuclear issue. They exchanged views on the approach for the weeks ahead, including in the perspective of the AIEA Board of Governors meeting of 25 November.</p>
<p>The Presidency noted that the EU would remain engaged, notably through the efforts of France, Germany and the UK, reinforced by the Secretary General / High Representative for PESC, Javier Solana, with a view to achieving progress on the Iranian nuclear issue.</p>

<p>(EN) On 5 July of this year, the Council adopted a Decision under Article 104(6) of the Treaty establishing that an excessive deficit exists in Greece, and an accompanying Recommendation under Article 104(7) to Greece with a view to bringing to an end the situation of excessive deficit.</p>
<p>This is the standard procedure followed in all cases where the Council establishes that an excessive deficit exists in a Member State.</p>
<p>The text of that Council Recommendation has, in accordance with the wishes of the Greek government and with paragraph 6, addressed to the Member States, of the Resolution of the European Council on the Stability and Growth Pact<a href="#defann_10_1" name="refann_10_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, been made public. It calls upon the Greek authorities to put an end to the excessive deficit situation by 2005 at the latest and establishes a deadline of 5 November 2004 for the Greek government to take effective action to this end.</p>
<p>In the light of that deadline of 5 November, the ECOFIN Council is scheduled to review the situation of Greece at its meeting on 16 November. All formal steps in the excessive deficit procedure are based on Recommendations by the Commission, so any formal Council action would be dependent on an initiative by the Commission.</p>
<p>The Council will take account of all relevant factors in its analysis of Greece's response to its excessive deficit Recommendation, including the prudence of its macro-economic scenario and the ambition of its deficit adjustment path. However, it must be noted that the precise definition of the adjustment path and the content of the measures taken to meet it are left to the discretion of the individual Member State concerned.</p>
<p>The Treaty and the Stability and Growth Pact provide for regular surveillance by both the Commission and Council of the budgetary situation of all Member States, with a possibility for additional surveillance of those with excessive deficits. The Council will address this and all other pertinent issues in its consideration of the situation in Greece at its meeting on 16 November.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The culpable silence, sanctimony and empty rhetoric on the part of the EU and UN equating the persecutor, the heavily-armed Israeli forces backed by a powerful nuclear arsenal, with the victim, the unarmed Palestinian people, effectively endorses the barbarity of the Israeli Government, characterised by daily Israeli army incursions, killings, the destruction of houses and the continued building of the 'wall of shame', with a view to perpetuating the invasion and occupation of territories and the genocide of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p>(EN) At its meeting on 11 October 2004, the Council expressed its grave concern at the unprecedented cycle of retaliatory violence in Israel and the Occupied Territories. The Council reiterated its full and unconditional condemnation of all forms of terrorism, including rocket attacks into Israel (which resulted in the death of Israeli children), and called upon the Palestinian Authority to take firm action against the planners and perpetrators of such terrorist acts. While recognising that Israel has the right to protect its citizens from terrorist attacks, the Council stressed that the exercise of this right should take place within the boundaries of international law. In particular as regards the recent Israeli military actions in the Gaza Strip the Council condemned the disproportionate nature of these Israeli military actions which claimed the lives of many innocent civilians, including children, and left many injured.</p>

<p>(NL) On 11 October, the Council expressed its satisfaction at the adoption of Resolution 1565 of the UN Security Council, which further reinforces the mandate of the United Nations Mission in the Democratic Republic of Congo (MONUC) and calls for a significant increase and improvement of MONUC’s capabilities, thus enabling it to fulfil the important tasks assigned to it. The Council has, in this connection, drawn the attention to the responsibility of the international community, including the regional actors, to pledge their unqualified support to the peace process in the Democratic Republic of Congo.</p>
<p>The Council has reiterated its conclusions of September about EU support and the UN’s efforts to reinforce MONUC, and underlines that the European Union and its Member States should now look into the contributions they could make to MONUC, the main focus of attention in this respect being the specific request in the UN Secretary General’s third report on MONUC. In this connection, the EU will, among others, pledge EU support to MONUC by providing it with access to the SATCEN (EU Satellite Centre) funds.</p>
<p>The Council has asked the competent Council authorities, on the basis of indications from the Member States and in close consultation with the relevant UN bodies, to start a clearing-house procedure in a bid, via a coordinated European response, to boost MONUC’s capabilities. The Council hopes to receive a report about the results of these efforts in November. Moreover, the Council has asked the competent Council authorities to examine whether the EU, whether or not as part of the ESDP, could do something in the area of police training and the reform of security bodies, one example being the integration and training of the army. The question as to whether they will contribute troops to MONUC must, however, ultimately be answered by the individual Member States themselves. </p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0350"></a>

The Council has not yet held a formal vote on this political agreement, partly because, in addition to the growing challenge from the broad-based movement for free software, software publishers, programmers, scientists and small and medium-sized enterprises, the proposal has encountered opposition from national parliaments, with the Dutch parliament calling on the country's government to withdraw its support for the directive, i.e. to vote against the earlier political agreement.</p>

<p>During the sitting of 4 March 2004, the Council adopted the joint Commission/Council report on the results of the review of the National Social Inclusion Plans 2003-2005. The report shows that Greece places social protection at the heart of its overall development strategy. The plan is to coordinate general policies – such as policies on economic growth and structural change – aimed at maintaining the rate of growth in social spending, and, at the same time, to draw up specific policies aimed at combating poverty and social exclusion.</p>
<p>Stepping up social cohesion is one of the Lisbon Strategy’s core objectives, which include the modernisation of social systems in order to improve the way those systems work and in order to fight poverty more effectively and to increase social inclusion.</p>
<p>I wish to point out, moreover, that the mid-term review of the whole of the Lisbon Strategy will be the subject of a report by a group of experts chaired by Wim Kok, to be presented at the beginning of November.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Dutch Presidency recently held a round table on experiments carried out during the two stages of the action plans devoted to social inclusion. The purpose of this round table was to make a contribution towards evaluating the process of open coordination of policies connected with social inclusion. The Commission expressed its intention to evaluate this process in 2005.</p>

<p>(EN) Similar to what was agreed in earlier enlargements, the Accession Treaty foresees a transitional period for the free movement of workers for the eight countries of Central and Eastern Europe that joined the EU on 1 May 2004.</p>
<p>It foresees a two-year period during which national measures will be applied by the EU-15 Member States, which can include specific bilateral agreements or can de facto result in full market labour access. After this period, reviews will be held, and, depending on the outcome, such national measures can continue to apply for a maximum of three more years, after which the transitional arrangement should in principle come to an end. Only in exceptional and serious cases will an EU-15 Member State be able to continue to apply national measures up to the end of the seventh year after accession. The Council underlines that the EU-15 Member States must give preference to nationals from the eight new Member States concerned over non-EU labour and stresses the strong elements of differentiation and flexibility in the arrangement for the free movement of workers. EU-15 Member States must endeavour to grant increased labour market access to nationals from these eight new Member States concerned under national law, with a view to speeding up the approximation to the acquis.</p>
<p>As a consequence, the employment opportunities in the EU for nationals from the eight new Member States to which the transitional arrangement applies should improve substantially upon their accession, including for the professions referred to by the Honourable Member. However, it should again be noted that, during the transitional period, it is the Member States that decide on national measures, which can include bilateral agreements, quotas, or full liberalisation.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0332"></a>

<p>(FR) The Commission proposes adopting texts aimed at increasing legal certainty for undertakings entrusted with public service missions and receiving financial support for this purpose from the Member States. The Commission has drawn up a draft Commission decision on the basis of Article 86(3) of the Treaty and a draft Community framework for State aid in the form of public service compensation. The purpose of those drafts is to specify the conditions under which Member States can award public service compensation constituting State aid in accordance with Community rules on State aid. The decision on the basis of Article 86(3) will, in particular, make it possible to exempt from prior notification those compensation projects the amounts for which are below thresholds to be established. The Commission also plans to extend the benefit of this decision to hospitals and to social housing undertakings.</p>
<p>In particular, the aforementioned drafts follow up broad public consultation organised by the Commission on the basis of its Green Paper on services of general interest in Europe. The Commission decided to submit these drafts to Parliament, the Economic and Social Committee and the Committee of the Regions for their opinions. The Committee of the Regions adopted an opinion at its meeting of 29 September 2004. The Commission is awaiting the opinions of Parliament and the Economic and Social Committee.</p>
<p>Experts from Member States were consulted on those draft texts in April 2004, and a fresh meeting might be held in 2005, should this prove necessary.</p>
<p>The Commission also put the draft texts on the Competition Directorate-General’s website so that any interested third parties might submit their comments.</p>

<p>(EN) The Commission is glad to be given the opportunity to present its position on the problem of cetacean bycatch in pair trawling for bass, which attracted significant attention in the press recently.</p>
<p>The Commission indeed received a UK request in July for an emergency closure of the bass fishery using pelagic pair trawls in the Western Channel, on the grounds that current levels of by-catch may constitute a threat to the common dolphin population. After having carefully scrutinised this request, the Commission decided to reject it.</p>
<p>This is because the Commission believes that the legal requirements justifying recourse to the emergency procedure foreseen in Article 7 of Regulation 2371/2002 on the Common Fisheries Policy were not fulfilled. The sea bass pair trawl fishery takes place during the winter, with a marked concentration of fishing effort in February and March. Its immediate closure by way of a Commission emergency procedure did not appear justified, whatever the merits of the case, given that normal Community procedures, following consultation of scientific experts and all interested parties, would allow time for the adoption of any necessary measure before the main period of this fishery.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the immediate action proposed by the United Kingdom was in the Commission’s view unlikely to achieve the desired goal. According to the evidence available, a prohibition on the use of pair trawl to target sea bass in the Western Channel could simply result in a redistribution of fishing effort either into other fisheries in the same area or into adjacent areas, without necessarily reducing the by-catch of dolphins. The background information accompanying the UK request did not provide radically new evidence on the appropriateness of the measure. The need for a comprehensive monitoring of the numerous trawl fisheries active in this region before being precise about mitigation requirements has been recognised by the Parliament and endorsed by the Council earlier this year, when in April it adopted Regulation No 812/2004 laying down a set of measures concerning incidental catches of cetaceans in fisheries. This comprehensive monitoring will begin on 1 January next.</p>
<p>This being said, the Commission shares the concerns to take appropriate measures to limit cetacean by-catch and is committed to working towards a solution of this problem in close cooperation with all interested parties.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0285"></a>

<p>(EN) With reference to the questions raised by the Honourable Member the Commission would like to point out the following:</p>
<p>1.	No specific legal framework has been established to protect the national character of sport in the twenty-five Member States. The application of the Community rules on the free movement of workers to sport is not dealt with in any specific Community legal provision, but is the result of the settled case law of the European Court of Justice<a href="#defann_24_1" name="refann_24_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. The Court held that sport was subject to Community law in so far as it constituted an economic activity, whether by professional or amateur athletes. The Court furthermore underlined that only rules concerning questions of purely sporting interest, and which as such, have nothing to do with economic activity, were not subject to the Community provisions in respect of the freedom of movement of persons and services.<a href="#defann_24_2" name="refann_24_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> In fact such regulations, which relate to the particular nature and context of sporting events, are inherent in the organisation and proper conduct of sporting competition and cannot be regarded as constituting a restriction on the Community rules on the freedom of movement of workers and the freedom to provide services. Where a sporting activity takes the form of gainful employment it will come, more particularly, within article 39 of the Treaty (ex article 48) and the prohibition of discrimination on grounds of nationality contained in articles 12 and 39 will apply. In addition article 7(4) of Regulation 1612/68 on freedom of movement will apply, so that collective agreements or any regulations concerning employment must be non-discriminatory. This is the case whether such agreements emanate from public authorities or private bodies.</p>
<p>The Court held in its judgement of 15 December 1995 in case C-415/93 - Bosman<a href="#defann_24_3" name="refann_24_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a> and in subsequent judgements that professional football was clearly an economic activity to which the Treaty could apply. The Court held that the transfer fee system was incompatible with article 39 of the Treaty. In addition, it held that article 39 precluded rules which limited the number of professional players from other Member States who could play in football competitions.</p>
<p>2.	On the basis of the Bosman ruling, FIFA has modified its regulations on the Status and Transfer of players after long discussions with the Commission. One of the main issues at stake was to find an appropriate balance between the player’s fundamental right to free movement and stability of contracts between football clubs and players in the specific context of sport. The outcome of the discussions was announced on 5 May 2001 following a meeting of the Members of the Commission with responsibility for Employment and Social Affairs, Competition, and Education and Culture with FIFA and UEFA. As a result, the new FIFA rules governing international transfers of football players became applicable on 1 September 2001. In case of disagreements on the application of these rules, the Commission would encourage, whenever possible, that these be addressed in the first instance, by the relevant sporting organisations bodies and if no solution is found, be put to national courts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission refers the Honourable Member to its statement in the plenary session of the European Parliament -Strasbourg, 11 March 2004- on the effects on the marine environment of low-frequency active sonar. This statement recalled the strict protection status of cetaceans in EU waters and informed the Parliament that the Commission has requested the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) to undertake a scientific review on this issue. This is considered as an essential basis for determining possible future actions needed to avoid cetacean disturbance, ensuring compliance with Habitats Directive.</p>
<p>This scientific review has been launched and draft conclusions are expected early in 2005. The Commission will make the results of this review available and will discuss with Member States in the Habitats Committee the best ways to protect cetaceans against sonar and other types of noise disturbance. Stakeholders will also be associated to these discussions.</p>
<p>In relation to the concerns expressed by the Honourable Member about the stranding of cetaceans on Fuerteventura and Lanzarote beaches, the Commission has received a study in relation to this case by the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in July 2004.</p>
<p>Further information on this case has been requested.

<p>Secondly, officials seconded to a Cabinet appointed to management posts:</p>
<p>Since the beginning of 2004, some Cabinet members – who in the period from January until the date of the question of the Honourable Member were already officials – have been appointed to management functions as follows:</p>
<p>there were 2 appointments to Director-General or equivalent functions of personnel who were in Cabinets. These appointments concerned Commission officials, of grade A*15 and A*14 respectively;</p>
<p>there were 7 appointments of personnel who were working in Cabinets at the level of Director or equivalent functions. Of these, five appointments took place after internal publication and two appointments following an external publication.</p>
<p>there have been 2 appointments of personnel who were working in Cabinets to a Head of Unit function.</p>
<p>Thirdly, Cabinet temporary agents appointed as officials onto non-management posts:</p>
<p>No former Cabinet temporary agents were recruited as non-management officials in the past half-year.

<p>(EN) Concerning the Community proposal, the total amount which was submitted directly to the Montreal Protocol and requested by these Member States was 4,577 tonnes which equates to 23.7% of the total amount of methyl bromide that was consumed for controlled uses in 1991 in the European Community. Consumption in 1991 is regarded as the ‘base level’ as all the reduction steps required by developed countries are relative to this 1991 base level.</p>
<p>Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 on ‘Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer’ limits the amount of methyl bromide that can be placed on the EC market in 2004 to 4,813 tonnes. The amount requested for critical uses in 2005 was 4.9% less than the amount permitted to be consumed in 2004. Since the quantity requested for critical uses is less than the previous year, this could be considered ‘phasing out’ (albeit rather minimal) rather than ‘phasing in’ methyl bromide.</p>
<p>As regards the international exemptions, at the Nairobi Meeting of the Parties, eight parties asked for more than 20% of their base level including five Parties that asked for more than 25% of their base level. The United States requested the Parties to approve 39% of its base level. The amount of methyl bromide requested by the United States alone exceeded to total amount of methyl bromide requested by all the other Parties combined.</p>
<p>The European Community, including many developing countries that have made significant progress in the phase out of methyl bromide, could not agree to the request submitted by the United States. The European Community considered that the environmental intent of the Montreal Protocol was not to allow production of methyl bromide that would exceed 30% of a Party’s base level since any more would be considered ‘phasing in’ rather than ‘phasing out’ methyl bromide.</p>
<p>Because the Parties could not agree, the negotiations broke down and an Extraordinary Meeting of the Parties was scheduled for March 2004 where discussions resumed. Agreement was reached on a 30% limit for any production of methyl bromide necessary to satisfy critical uses and, in addition, the Parties agreed a number of decisions that would encourage the phase out of methyl bromide for critical uses.</p>
<p>As regards the last question, there is no legal basis in the Montreal Protocol or Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 for limiting the amount of methyl bromide for critical uses. Therefore it is unnecessary to make any revision of Regulation (EC) No 2037/2000 to take account of decisions agreed by the Parties on the amount of methyl bromide that can be produced in the EC to satisfy critical uses of methyl bromide.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The new guidelines for the trans-European Transport network (TEN-T), as defined in the Parliament and Council’s Decision 884/04/EC<a href="#defann_29_1" name="refann_29_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> of 29/04/2004, include two priority projects which concern directly or indirectly the West of Ireland :</p>
<p>1)	The rail / road axis Ireland / UK / Continental Europe (project n. 26). Co-financing under the TEN-T programme applies respectively to two road sections between Cork-Dublin and Belfast, expected to be accomplished by 2004 and 2005, as well as to the upgrading of the rail between Cork-Dublin and Belfast, expected to be accomplished by 2008.</p>
<p>2)	Sea Motorways of the West of Europe.	Motorways of the Sea are a Community initiative to achieve modal shift and better links to islands and outlying regions by consolidating traffic flows in a high quality intermodal chain based on short sea shipping. The Commission has launched a consultation of interested parties on the execution of motorways of the sea projects under the TEN programme by means of a consultation document published on 30 July 2004, to which also the Irish Government has responded. The Commission will take into account all comments received when drafting the call for the selection procedure 2005.</p>
<p>The fact that a project is on the TEN-T makes it eligible for Community co-financing. Any specific financial support from the Commission will have to be requested for by the Irish Government, meeting the requirements of EC Regulation N° 807/2004<a href="#defann_29_2" name="refann_29_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>, signed by the Parliament and the Council on 21 April 2004.</p>
<p>In the context of the new financial perspective (2007-2013), the Commission is proposing to increase substantially the EU financial support for priority projects like the ones referred to above, with higher co-financing rates (up to 30%). This proposal is currently being examined by the Parliament and Council.</p>
<p>In addition to the TEN-T financing, the West of Ireland is in receipt of significant funds from the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) and the Cohesion Fund for the upgrading of its transport infrastructure, in the domains of both road and public transport.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Lisbon strategy – as defined by the European Council in March 2000 – was meant to support the then current dynamism through a stronger competitiveness.</p>
<p>The Competition policy has been identified as one of the major pillars of this strategy, since it has to create a common playing field for economic activities throughout the Union. In this respect, the Commission has put the emphasis on several key priorities to support the achievement of our goals in the competition area.</p>
<p>State aid reduction</p>
<p>At Lisbon, the Council, Commission and Member States were requested “to further their efforts to promote competition and reduce the general level of State aids”. At the Stockholm European Council, Member States undertook a commitment to demonstrate a downward trend in State aid in relation to Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2003.</p>
<p>The Commission’s latest State aid Scoreboard<a href="#defann_30_1" name="refann_30_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> confirms that by and large Member States are on the right track. The overall level of State aid<a href="#defann_30_2" name="refann_30_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> granted by the fifteen Member States in 2002 was estimated at €49 billion or 0.56% of GDP. Following the dramatic fall in the overall volume of aid during the late 1990s, total aid has continued to decline though less sharply than in previous years, falling on average at just over €1 billion per year over the period 2000 to 2002. Disparities between Member States still exist but are diminishing and virtually all Member States are in line with the Stockholm commitment.</p>
<p>State aid reorientation</p>
<p>The other commitment undertaken by Member States at Stockholm concerns the redirection of aid away from sectoral aids (which by their nature tend to be more distorting) towards horizontal aid which is usually aimed at correcting identified market failures. Here again the results are encouraging. Around 73% of total aid (less agriculture fisheries and transport) in 2002 was granted for horizontal objectives including Research &amp; Development, SMEs, environment and regional economic development. The remaining 27% was aid directed at specific sectors (mainly manufacturing, coal and financial services) including aid for rescue and restructuring. It is worth noting that while some Member States have regularly awarded aid to rescue and restructure ailing firms (e.g., Germany, France and Italy) others have clearly not had such a policy.</p>
<p>The share of aid granted for horizontal objectives increased by 7 percentage points over the period 2000 to 2002. This was largely the result of significant increases in aid for the environment (+7 points) and research and development (+4 points). This positive trend was observed, to varying degrees, in the majority of Member States. Indeed, in several Member States - Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Italy, Netherlands, Austria and Finland – virtually all the aid awarded in 2002 was earmarked for horizontal objectives, including cohesion.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding Member States efforts to reduce and redirect aid, the cumulative effect of €49 billion of State aid still has a considerable distortive effect on competition in the Internal Market. As well as the need to minimise distortion to competition, the grant of aid must also be balanced against constraints on national public finances. In this context, Member States have begun to exchange information on ongoing efforts to reduce and redirect aid and to evaluate the effectiveness of State aid measures.</p>
<p>Public procurement</p>
<p>Public procurement markets have become more transparent since the Lisbon Summit. The percentage of public procurement advertised in the Official Journal has increased by almost 70% between 1999 and 2002<a href="#defann_30_3" name="refann_30_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>. This increase was especially significant in Spain, France, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, Austria and the United Kingdom. A study of the Commission has also shown that up to 78% of the successful firms being awarded a contract (the value of which is) above the thresholds set by Directives are SMEs<a href="#defann_30_4" name="refann_30_4"><sup>(4)</sup></a>, with the percentage ranging from 65% in the UK to 92% in Luxembourg. This is encouraging as the access of SMEs to public procurement can be seen as an important indicator of the openness of public procurement.</p>
<p>The new public procurement directives were adopted after a long gestation period. The implementation of these directives is not only expected to boost transparency and to further develop cross-border business activity but more particularly to contribute significantly to the improvement of the efficiency of public spending. In a sample of products surveyed in another Commission study, the application of procurement rules appears to reduce prices by around 30%<a href="#defann_30_5" name="refann_30_5"><sup>(5)</sup></a>. If hypothetical savings equivalent to 10% of public procurement spending would be achieved, all Member States would conveniently meet the Stability and Growth Pact<a href="#defann_30_6" name="refann_30_6"><sup>(6)</sup></a>.</p>
<p>Services sector</p>
<p>Services account for around 70% of economic activity in the EU; Intra EU-trade in services as a percentage of GDP is lower today than it was 10 years ago. Services also account for 60-70% of employment in all Member States; between 1997 and 2002, 96% of all job creation in the EU was in services, representing 11.4m new jobs. A wide range of legal and administrative barriers inhibit cross-border trade in services, (including permanent establishment in another Member State); the barriers are similar across services sectors; many barriers are prima facie incompatible with the Treaty.</p>
<p>Services are everywhere in the economy, as final services delivered to consumers and businesses and as inputs to manufacturers and other service providers; as a result, a barrier to the provision of a single service has effects throughout the supply chain and throughout the economy</p>
<p>The Commission adopted a proposal for a Directive on Services in the Internal Market on 13 January 2004.</p>
<p>The objective of the proposal is to create a better functioning Internal Market for Services. It seeks to create a well-balanced European legal framework aiming to facilitate the freedom of establishment and freedom to provide services. Exercising the freedom of establishment will be easier because of administrative simplification, including the modernisation of authorisation schemes and the removal or evaluation of a number of specified requirements. Exercising the freedom to provide services will be made easier by the country of origin principle (coupled with derogations), as well as specific provisions governing the rights of recipients of services and administrative co-operation.</p>
<p>The proposal covers a wide range of different services provided as an economic activity to consumers and to businesses. The Commission estimates that the services covered by the proposal account for some 50% of EU GDP and for some 60% of employment in the Union, though an exact figure is hard to determine as many services are provided by manufacturers of goods and thus not caught by available statistics.</p>
<p>With the report on competition in professional services on 9 February 2004, the Commission has highlighted an area in particular where restrictions to competition are still high. While the Commission acknowledges that some regulation in this sector is justified, it believes that in some cases more pro competitive mechanisms can and should be used instead of certain traditional restrictive rules. Ultimately, in all scrutiny of professional regulation a proportionality test should be applied, in order to ensure that these regulations truly fulfil their objective. The Commission therefore invites the regulatory authorities in the Member States and the professional bodies to review existing rules, taking into consideration whether those rules are necessary and proportionate to achieve a public interest objective, and whether they are necessary for good practice of the profession. The Commission will report on progress in 2005.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is aware of the floods that have occurred this summer in Finland.</p>
<p>However, the Structural Fund programmes implemented in Finland during the current programming period 2000-2006 have not foreseen a funding reserve for damages caused by natural disasters nor have the Finnish rural development programmes foreseen the possibility to fund the measure, provided by Council Regulation (EC) No 1257/1999 on support for rural development from the European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), enabling to restore agricultural production potential damaged by natural disasters and to introduce appropriate prevention instruments. Besides, the Commission has not received a request to modify any of these programmes.</p>
<p>The EU Solidarity Fund can provide assistance in the event of a major disaster under certain conditions, e.g. threshold for damages € 3 billion, and in exception cases also when more specific criteria apply. The EU Solidarity Fund is limited to help finance public expenditure related to the disaster and may not be used to compensate private losses. So far Finland has not submitted any application for funding from the Solidarity Fund either.</p>
<p>However, in 2001 Finland notified the Commission a national State aid to compensate for the loss caused by flood<a href="#defann_31_1" name="refann_31_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>, which was approved by Commission<a href="#defann_31_2" name="refann_31_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a>.

<p>(EN) The European Partnership for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia<a href="#defann_33_1" name="refann_33_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> identifies the strengthening of the rule of law as a crucial priority for reform.</p>
<p>The EU is heavily engaged in supporting the Government’s reform efforts through the regular political dialogue with the country’s authorities as well as through EC financial assistance.</p>
<p>The EU’s engagement is comprehensive and multi-pronged:</p>
<p>It is assisting the process of reform of the police services. The overall EU engagement in policing comprises an European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) police mission, PROXIMA, and a project funded through EC Community assistance for reconstruction, development and stabilisation programme (CARDS) assistance focusing on the provision of strategic advice for the implementation of the Government’s police reform strategy which was developed with expert advice under previous EC-funded activities.</p>
<p>The government has also adopted an integrated border management strategy developed with EC assistance, which is currently under implementation. It is working closely with the Commission on a comprehensive judicial reform strategy which is being finalised. Ongoing and programmed EC assistance efforts are directed towards developing an increased independency of the judiciary, a more effective courts system, easier access to justice and enhanced legal certainty.</p>
<p>Further projects funded through the CARDS programme aim at supporting the development of an effective anti-money laundering capacity and combating financial crimes. A major programme of support for the reform of the customs administration is currently being implemented (Customs and Fiscal Administration Office – CAFAO-MAK).</p>
<p>An underlying objective of our approach is that of addressing the root causes of corruption through the combined action of different programmes.</p>
<p>However, it is worth noting the EU is only supporting and providing advice in the context of a process whose ownership remains firmly with the country’s authorities.</p>
<p>The EU engagement has proved effective so far in generating a degree of political commitment towards the reform process and concrete practical results. However, much remains to be done and many structural and legislative weaknesses need to be overcome.</p>
<p>The EU will remain engaged and continue to support the country’s reform efforts and monitoring its progress in this crucial area of cooperation in the coming years.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The White Paper on services of general interest states that “Concerning media pluralism, the public consultation highlighted that, in the light of the differences that exist across the Member States, the issue should be left to the Member States at this point in time.

<p>(EN) The Commission agrees with the Honourable Member that EU citizens and business must have confidence in the EU legal framework if they are to maintain a positive view of the Community. The free movement provisions of the Treaty are fundamental to the EU and are amongst the major benefits of membership. Accordingly, the Commission places the highest priority on maintaining the integrity of the Internal Market and carefully investigates all complaints in exactly the same way, irrespective of where they come from or which Member State they concern.</p>
<p>As far as the free movement of capital is concerned, the Commission is unaware of instances in which Polish firms in the Netherlands, France, Italy, Germany or other Member States have been discriminated against. No such complaints have been brought to the Commission's attention by parties concerned.</p>
<p>As far as the free movement of services is concerned, the Commission will write to the relevant Member States and request further information on the alleged breaches of EC law. On the basis of the information received, the Commission will assess the situation in each Member State and decide whether to start infringement procedures. More in general, the Commission is well aware from its work in the context of the Internal Market Strategy for Services that service providers from all Member States face considerable problems when attempting to do business across borders in the EU. The scale and range of barriers to service provision across all Member States is such that the Commission concluded that infringement procedures alone would not be sufficient to achieve a well-functioning Internal Market in services. Accordingly, in January 2004, the Commission proposed a Directive on Services to address many of these barriers. It will be important that the Parliament examines this proposal as efficiently as possible in order for the Directive to be approved during 2005.</p>
<p>The Commission would also like to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the SOLVIT network, which is operational in all 25 Member States. This network deals with problems caused by the misapplication of Internal Market law by public authorities. The aim of SOLVIT, which is free of charge, is to solve such problems quickly and informally, thus avoiding lengthy and costly legal proceedings at national or Community level. The SOLVIT centres in each Member State’s administration work together and are committed to finding a solution within 10 weeks. If Polish firms take their complaints forward through the SOLVIT system and their problems remain unresolved, or if they consider that the proposed solutions are unacceptable, they can still pursue legal action through a national court or lodge a formal complaint with the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0314"></a>

<p>Whereas Council Directive 79/409/EEC on the conservation of wild birds<a href="#defann_37_2" name="refann_37_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> does allow for derogations from the strict protection regime applying to wild birds these must be in accordance with the conditions specified in the Directive, including the absence of other satisfactory solutions. One of the possible justifications for use of derogations is ‘for the protection of flora and fauna’, which may include the protection of ‘feral pigeons’. It is Member States who decide on whether to apply a derogation under the Directive, the use of which must be reported to Commission.</p>
<p>However, in considering the use of a derogation Member States would need to take full account of the primary objective of the Directive to conserve wild birds and not be damaging to the conservation status of the species affected by the derogation. Any use of a derogation would also need to be fully justified scientifically. It would need to be targeted to the specific problem and proportionate in its application.</p>
<p>Finally, it should be noted that the populations of many birds of prey in the European Union are still comparatively rare and sensitive to human activities. Therefore, any possible use of derogations to deal with the potential conflict that may arise with racing pigeons would need to be very strongly justified.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>If the outgoing Commissioner pushes through her plans in this way, it may again lead to considerable unrest in many European ports.</p>

<p>In its reply to question <a href="/doceo/document/E-6-2004-1613_EN.html">E-1613/04</a> the Commission has finally admitted that it cannot distinguish between deep-sea species and demersal species. To date, no list of vessels authorised to carry out deep sea fishing under Regulation (EC) 2347/2002<a href="#defann_41_1" name="refann_41_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a> exists, or if it does, it has not been published. Regulation (EC) 1954/2003<a href="#defann_41_2" name="refann_41_2"><sup>(2)</sup></a> revoked the main instrument for monitoring fishing effort, namely the effort registers. The same Regulation also revoked all the restrictions on fishing gear (bottom trawls, bottom gill nets, regulations on hooks) which had existed in the Azores Autonomous Region.</p>
<p>In practice, the Commission has virtually eliminated all forms of monitoring and safeguarding the Atlantic seabed, thus further encouraging the destruction of resources already largely devastated in international waters, but was still safeguarded in the Azores Autonomous Region. Does the Commission intend to change its policy in response to the urgent needs of the real situation, or is its preferred course simply to wait until the time arrives to write the epitaph for the deep-sea natural resources of the Atlantic Ocean?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) As regards the reply given by the Commission to the written question 1613/04 that the Honourable Member refers to, it did not say that the Commission cannot distinguish between deep-sea species and demersal species. What it quite clearly said was that the Commission does not keep defined lists of which species are pelagic and demersal, respectively, simply because the distinction between the two groups is self-evident both as regards the difference in biology of the species and the different nature of the fisheries. It has never been found to be necessary to establish such lists and there is no change to that assessment at present; however, should there arise any uncertainties in the future the Commission would review the need for it.</p>
<p>When it comes to deep-sea species, it is perfectly clear from the Annexes to Council Regulation 2347/2002 which deep-sea species are covered by that Regulation. These same species are excluded from the scope of the Western waters Regulation, 1954/2003, to avoid an overlapping of management measures which would create legal ambiguity. As concerns the lists of vessels, there is no obligation for Member States under Regulation 2347/2002 to send in lists of vessels that have been given a deep-sea fishing permit, and hence no publication of such lists is foreseen.</p>
<p>As regards Regulation 1954/2003, it does not revoke the effort monitoring system but it replaces the old system from 1995 with a new one which is consistent with the new legal situation after 2002 when the transitional measures for Spain and Portugal came to an end. The new system is intended to avoid any increase in fishing effort in Western waters as well as any major shift of fishing effort between large fishing areas. Restrictions in the use of fishing gear are not dealt with in this Regulation, because these issues fall under the technical measures Regulation 850/98. The Commission has indeed proposed an amendment to the latter Regulation in order to prohibit the use of bottom trawls in sensitive areas around the Azores, Madeira and the Canary Islands. Moreover, in order to avoid any risk of damage in these areas while the legislative procedures are going on, including the deliberations of European Parliament, the Commission has also proposed an amendment to the TAC and Quota Regulation for this year which would implement the ban on a provisional basis until such time that the amendment to 850/98 has been adopted.</p>
<p>In summary, the Commission cannot agree with the Honourable Member that the Commission has eliminated all forms of monitoring and safeguarding of the Atlantic seabed. Under the Common Fisheries Policy, there is a whole series of measures on conservation of resources and marine habitats in the Atlantic, including the waters around the Azores. These measures consist mainly of TACs and quotas, technical measures and effort limitation schemes. If there are further conservation measures that the Honourable Member would like to suggest, the Commission is, as always, open to have a constructive discussion. As already said on a number of occasions, the Commission does not believe that limiting access is a conservation measure. Limited access is a socio-economic measure to the benefit of coastal regions and outermost regions, which will not in itself guarantee any conservation effects. In order to achieve the conservation objectives that we have set for ourselves, we should use the appropriate measures available under the Common Fisheries Policy mentioned before.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission focuses its cooperation with Colombia on improving the respect for human rights, alleviating the humanitarian crisis, and on the support to grassroots peace initiatives (the so-called ‘Peace Laboratories’).</p>
<p>In Colombia, the Commission is working on these issues both with the civil society (notably NGOs e.g. for humanitarian assistance) and with the Colombian Government, in keeping with the objective of ‘ownership’ of the EC cooperation activities by the partner state. For instance in 2004 the Commission approved a project worth € 10.5 million aiming at reducing impunity through the reform of the Colombian justice sector.</p>
<p>The Commission has repeatedly stressed the importance of taking early and effective action against collusion between elements of the Colombian security forces with paramilitary groups. Projects that we support through the European initiative for Democracy and Human Rights (notably prominent Colombian human rights defenders) contribute to that objective. The AUC paramilitaries (United Self-defence of Colombia, AUC) were added to the so-called ‘EU terrorist list’ on 2 May 2002.</p>
<p>By definition, our ‘Peace Laboratories’ project are implemented in conflictive areas where illegal armed groups are present. The objective of these ‘Peace Laboratories’ is precisely to defuse the conflict in these areas and foster democratic alternatives towards the resolution of structural socio-economic problems. The Commission is aware of the risks that illegal armed actors may try and exert influence on the processes brought about by the initiatives it supports. However, the Commission selects its partners after a cautious and transparent consultation process involving all the main stakeholders. The experience so far with the first ‘Peace Laboratory’ (in the Magdalena Medio region) has been positive.</p>
<p>After having looked into the matter, the Commission has found no element corroborating the allegation referred to by the Honourable Member that Mr. Euser Rondón would have been associated in any manner with the Community assistance cooperation programmes.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0327"></a>

<p>(EN) The EU has indeed sought commitments from a number of partners on the services related to water (such as distribution of water or wastewater management), as part of its wider negotiating proposal on environmental services. However, it is important to stress that the EC requests on water distribution clearly exclude any cross-border transportation either by pipeline or by any other means of transport, nor do they seek access to water resources. Moreover, they do not undermine or reduce in any way the host governments' ability to regulate water management and allocation among users, to choose whether and how the private sector may participate in the delivery of water and sanitation services and to impose equitable pricing policies and ensure affordability for the poor. In addition, the requests take into account the level of development of our trading partners. Developing, and in particular least developed countries, are not expected to open their market to foreign competition to the same extent, and at the same pace, as more developed countries. In this regard, developing guidelines on water related services has not been an option explored until now, in order not to prejudge the flexibility left to developing countries in particular to regulate this sensitive sector. The EC has and will continue to support developing countries in this respect, including through the provision of technical assistance.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the EU remains committed to the Millennium Development Goal target to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water, and to the targets agreed at the World Summit on Sustainable Development to halve by 2015 the proportion of people without access to basic sanitation and for countries to have integrated water resource management and efficiency plans by 2005. The Commission considers that, properly managed, General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) negotiations can contribute to the achievement of these goals.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0334"></a>

<p>As regards trade with third countries, Council Directive 83/129/EEC prohibits the import of products derived from the pups of whitecoat harp seals and hooded seals (blue-backs) into the EU.</p>
<p>The Commission is aware that the Norwegian government amended its legislation in June 2004 to permit foreign nationals to take part in hunting for coastal seals. According to the Norwegian authorities, this measure would give hunting for coastal seals the same status as hunting for terrestrial mammals.</p>
<p>An import into the EU of products of the harp seal pups, a species which is found in Norway, would be prohibited under the scope of Directive Council Directive 83/129/EEC.</p>
<p>Since seals are migratory species, the Commission services will follow the development of seal hunting in Norway to determine if there is any detrimental impact on the seals population in the EU.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0344"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission considers its macroeconomic scenario to be more realistic than that of the Greek government. The latter scenario considers that Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will grow at 3.9% in 2005, while the Commission projects growth at 3.3%.</p>
<p>The unemployment problem of Greece is mainly of a structural nature. Therefore, fiscal policy is not at the core of the labour market problems in Greece. Within the framework of the Broad economic policy guidelines (BEPGs), the Council recommended the Greek authorities to: a) Improve work incentives, particularly in tax and pension systems, in order to encourage increased employment in the formal sector, including part-time work; b) Promote changes to the wage bargaining system with a view to ensure that wages reflect productivity differentials; and c) Implement the labour reform package to improve the balance between flexibility and security by ensuring effective implementation of reforms aiming to modernise work organisation and by reviewing unduly restrictive labour market regulations.</p>
<p>As far as the budgetary adjustment is concerned, in its recommendations under Article 104 (7) of the Treaty the Council recommended the Greek authorities to reduce the excessive deficit below 3% of GDP in 2005 at the latest and to distribute the total adjustment over 2004 and 2005.</p>
<p>Finally, in order to ensure the long-term sustainability of public finances in the face of population ageing, especially in view of the high government debt ratio, the Council, also in the framework of the BEPGs, recommends the Greek authorities to move towards achieving a medium-term close to balance or in surplus position through effective control of current primary spending. Action taken by the Greek authorities in this field is assessed on an annual basis within the framework of the implementation report, as well as in the assessment of the Stability Programme. Furthermore, the Council in accordance with Article 104 (7) of the Treaty and to Regulation 1467/97 (On speeding up and clarifying the implementation of the Excessive Deficit Procedure) recommended the Greek authorities on 5 July 2004 to undertake measures of structural nature to reduce the excessive deficit below the 3% of GDP reference value by 2005 at the latest. The Council also recommended the Greek authorities to reduce the debt ratio at a satisfactory pace and to correct the serious deficiencies revealed in the process of validating the EDP notification. The Greek government should announce/implement corrective measure by 5 November 2004. If Greece has not taken effective actions in response to recommendations by then, the Commission would take additional steps within the excessive deficit procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0346"></a>

<p>The Commission’s fourth report on the implementation of that regulation, dated 24 April 2002<a href="#defann_48_3" name="refann_48_3"><sup>(3)</sup></a>, says, on this question, that the liberalisation of previously protected services to maritime cabotage on 1 January 1999 did not lead to significant penetration of national markets by vessels flying the flag of other Member States. This was particularly true in Greece, not least due to its geographical position and to the competitiveness of its fleet. Nevertheless, the quality of the services provided appears to have improved, which has in turn led to increased traffic in some countries.</p>
<p>The Commission has no doubt that this liberalisation, which has not, in fact, been implemented in full in Greece, will produce all the expected benefits in that country.</p>
<p>It should also be pointed out that the provisions contained in the above-mentioned Regulation as regards crew and public service are intended to play a moderating role.</p>

Does the Commission consider its package of measures adequate? Does it assume that part of the European textile industry will be destroyed no matter what happens?

<p>(EN) The Commission is fully aware of the situation of the textiles and clothing industry as well as its economic importance in terms of employment and industrial output.</p>
<p>The precise impact of abolishing quotas cannot be assessed but could be considerable. It will depend on how industry and the national and regional public authorities respond with policies to make their textile industry competitive. In general, the long term impact of quota removal is likely to vary greatly depending on country conditions and domestic policy responses.</p>
<p>There may be substitution effect among suppliers to the advantage of the countries that are able to offer a full range of products, economies of scale, competitive prices as well as efficient services. Given the massive industry in place and the enormous amount of capacity still under construction, China is forecast to be on the top of the list, most probably at the expenses of other developing countries more than of EU Textile and Clothing (T&amp;C) industry. This is exactly the reason why specific provisions had been included in China’s protocol accession to the World Trade Organisation (WTO). As regards the possible use of safeguards, it should be considered only if and when the legal conditions are met, and as a last resort. The Commission intends therefore to issue guidelines regarding the criteria for the implementation of the safeguard clause. This should lead to the clarification of the rules of procedure for complaints or requests for safeguards by the industry and criteria that the Commission intend to follow, in conformity with the relevant Regulations adopted by the Council, for the application of safeguard clauses and in particular for the textiles-specific safeguard clause set out in China’s Protocol of Accession to the WTO.</p>
<p>In this context, the Commission also intends to put in place a system of monitoring of China’s textiles imports into the EU on the basis of an automatic import licences system that will allow to follow up the developments of the market almost in real time as per January 1 and contribute to determining swiftly if the conditions for the use of the above clause are met.</p>
<p>Concerning the package of measures the Commission has been preparing to face these challenges raised by the Honourable Member, the Commission wishes to draw attention to the textile communication adopted on 13 October 2004 entitled “Textile and Clothing after 2005 - Recommendations of the High Level Group for textiles and clothing”, where the Commission builds on the work carried out by the High Level Group in which Members of the Parliament participated and proposes several actions to enhance the competitiveness of the European textile industry in a fair post-ATC (Agreement on Textile and Clothing) environment. Obviously, the Commission shares the concerns expressed that China’s export potential could put the EU industry under strain. In this connection it wishes to point out that it is monitoring closely China’s compliance with its WTO accession commitments, most notably in the framework of the textile EU-China dialogue set up on 6 May 2004 by the Commissioner in charge of Trade and his Chinese counterpart Trade minister Bo Xilai.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0354"></a>

<p>It is greatly to be feared that if the above document is taken as the legislative basis for the reform of the COM in sugar - and if, in particular, the national quotas A and B are merged and each Member State's overall quota is reduced by 16% - an immense amount of damage will be done and many competitive sugarbeet farmers and sugar manufacturers (especially ones in the new Member States) will be driven into bankruptcy. The impact of such measures would be felt particularly strongly by sugarbeet farmers and sugar manufacturers in the Czech Republic - a country which has long been one of the EU's leading sugar producers.</p>
<p>Does the Commission realise that by acting in such a fashion it would deprive the above-mentioned Member States (in particular the Czech Republic) of their self-sufficiency and make them dependent on imports of more expensive sugar from abroad, whereas the countries in question are capable of manufacturing high-quality sugar cheaply and would be fully competitive if a level playing-field existed? Furthermore, does the Commission not think that such a state of affairs would completely undermine one of the stated aims of the reform, which is to switch sugarbeet cultivation and sugar manufacturing to productive, competitive parts of the EU?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The reform proposal of the Commission as laid down in its Communication on the reform of the European sugar sector of 14 July 2004 aims at achieving better market orientation and higher competitiveness of this sector in line with the general objectives of the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) reform whilst taking into consideration the constraints deriving from international commitments on the EU sugar market.</p>
<p>To achieve these objectives in a single market it is key that the current system of repartitioning of production over all Member States is reconsidered and that production moves to the production areas with higher competitive advantages. The suggestion to limit the necessary quota cuts to the B quotas would therefore undermine the major motivation for reform as it would harm more strongly the most competitive producers.</p>
<p>The Commission recognises, however, that reform will affect beet farmers and sugar processors and that production may be reduced or even stop in some Member States. To cushion this impact the reform proposal foresees a series of measures: Farmers will be compensated on the basis of their beet production in the past and in addition, may switch to alternative and more competitive crops. By allowing for quota transfer, inefficient sugar producers will be able to sell their quota, and if this is not possible apply for a conversion aid.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0356"></a>

<p>With a view to the next financial perspective, the European Commission has brought forward a proposal for the introduction of a single rural development fund (EARDF) under which the number of actions eligible for funding is increased, primarily as a result of the introduction of Natura 2000, while the level of funding allocated to rural development - the second pillar of the common agricultural policy - remains the same. This proposal is not only financially unviable but also completely ignores the need to award greater priority to measures targeting young farmers and to provide them with more resources to assist hand-over to the next generation, lack of which is one of the main problems currently affecting rural areas.</p>
<p>Does the Commission not consider that it should reassess its order of priorities, taking into account the paucity of funds available for rural development?</p>
<p>Does it not feel that it should also consider an adjustment to the current financial perspective in order to meet the demands Parliament made in connection with the 2005 budget to increase the resources allocated to young farmers?</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) 1.	The proposal for the future EU rural development policy 2007-2013<a href="#defann_52_1" name="refann_52_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>presents an adapted menu of measures which have been divided in three priority Axis: Axis 1: Improving the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sector; Axis 2 land management and enhancing the environment; and Axis 3, diversification of the rural economy and the quality of life. The new proposal will be funded by a budget of 97.2 billion euros (in 2004 prices).</p>
<p>The first priority axis continues to include the measure “Setting up of young farmers” within the subgroup of measures aimed at improving the human potential (together with the measures: vocational training and information actions for persons engaged in the agricultural and forestry sectors, early retirement of farmers and farm workers, use by farmers and forest holders of advisory services and setting up of farm management, farm relief and farm advisory services, as well as of forestry advisory services).</p>
<p>Farmers wanting to benefit from support under the measure “setting up of young farmers” have to fulfil a new condition: to submit a business plan for the development of their farming activities. Moreover, the maximum amount of the single premium has been increased from 25.000 to 40.000 euros.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the measure “support for the modernisation of farms” will continue to have higher support rates where the investment projects are presented by young farmers.</p>
<p>The future EU Rural Development Policy will continue to be based on the principle of subsidiarity; that is to say, Member States and regions will have to set up their rural development programmes on the basis of their priorities and needs. It will be up to them to select the “setting up of young farmers” measure in their programmes and also to use other measures -such as training or early retirement- to facilitate the generational transfer of agricultural activities in the context of an ageing EU agriculture and also to decide on the amounts to allocate to these measures within their rural development programmes.</p>
<p>2.	In the current 2000-2006 programming period, almost all Member States from the EU-15 have chosen to include the setting up of young farmers in their rural development programmes and this measure represents around 3,7% on average of the total European Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF) monies for the period 2000-2006. Regarding the 10 new Member States, five have included this measure in their 2004-2006 rural development programmes and it represents 2% of the total programmed budget during the period 2004-2006.</p>
<p>The budgets allocated to the rural development programmes have to respect the financial perspectives 2000-2006 agreed in Berlin in 1999. A modification to transfer money from other measures to the “setting up of young farmers” measure is possible within the total allocation, if a Member State wishes to do so.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>The historic Gulf of Marathon is being threatened with destruction because of the construction of an artificial island for commercial purposes together with a marina at Nea Makri.

Thousands of tons of concrete will be used, further damaging the environment, and the sea will be polluted by waste from hundreds of vessels resulting in a deep-sea ecological disaster since over 26 hectares of posidonia seagrass will disappear, while the quality of life of local inhabitants will suffer from the resulting socio-economic disruption.</p>
<p>Is the Commission aware of the project and related funding, which are infringing Community law since the project will involve the destruction of a historic region protected under the Natura 2000 programme?

<p>(EN) The Commission has already received a letter from the inhabitants of Nea Makri, which object to a proposed yachting marina. Based on the available information, the Commission is of the view that there are no grounds for considering that EC environmental legislation has been infringed.</p>
<p>The area of Nea Makri has not been proposed by the Greek authorities as Site of Community Importance on the basis of relevant scientific information and the criteria set out in Annex III of Directive 92/43/EEC<a href="#defann_53_1" name="refann_53_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. In particular, with regard to the protection of the habitat type “Posidonia beds”, it should be stressed that Article 6 of the Directive sets out provisions which govern the conservation and management of Natura 2000 sites and does not protect specific habitat types outside of the sites proposed under the Directive.</p>
<p>Regarding the effects of the project on the proposed Site of Community Importance of Schinias-Marathonas (code GR 3000003), it must be noted that the site is not close to Nea Makri and its marine and coastal zones are limited. In addition, the study prepared for the project, which was sent to the Commission by the inhabitants of Nea Makri, takes duly into account the existence of the site and refers to the Presidential Decree for the protection of the site. The project is therefore not likely to have a significant effect on the site or to adversely affect its integrity. Consequently, there is no violation of Article 6 of Directive 92/43/EEC.</p>
<p>As regards the impact on the cultural heritage, the ministerial decision approving the location of the yachting marina includes specific conditions, such as the supervision of the works by the services responsible for archaeology or suspension of the works where archaeological findings are brought to light.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Honourable Member refers in his question to the five Member States that have not yet transposed the directives making up the new EU e-communications regulatory framework.</p>
<p>As of 14 October twenty Member States had notified the adoption of legislation to transpose the new regulatory framework (five European Parliament and Council directives). This represents a considerable achievement for each of them.</p>
<p>The Commission launched infringement proceedings in October last year against those of the EU15 Member States which had not notified transposition of the five Directives, and proceedings are already pending before the Court of Justice (Belgium, Greece, and Luxembourg). The Commission is considering infringement action in regard to the two new Member States (Czech Republic, Estonia) concerned.</p>
<p>Secondary legislation is still to be adopted in several Member States in order to give full effect to primary legislation. The Commission is monitoring this process closely, and further action will if necessary be taken against those and other Members States under Article 226 of the Treaty as regards the conformity of national legislation with the framework.</p>
<p>It is clearly a matter of concern that not all Member States have completed the process. However, delay does not mean regulatory relief for players with significant market power, to the extent that the remedies under the old framework continue to apply until determinations are made under the new (Article 27 Framework Directive).</p>
<p>As regards the Competition Directive (Commission Directive enshrining the principles of liberalisation), in the spring of this year the Commission brought Germany, Greece, France, Luxembourg and the Netherlands before the Court for not having supplied the Commission with information allowing it to confirm that the provisions of the Directive had been complied with. The Commission has subsequently closed the procedures against Germany, France, and the Netherlands. Belgium has provided information which, for the time being, does not seem sufficient to confirm that its legislation is fully compliant.</p>
<p>As regards the effect of legislation in those Member States in which it has been implemented, it is clear that rapid transposition is of vital importance to the sector. In particular, delay in transposition slows down the process whereby National Regulatory Authorities (NRAs) analyse markets and withdraw, amend or impose regulation in the light of the level of competition found to exist.</p>
<p>One important aspect of the new framework, which was strongly supported by the Parliament at the time of adoption of the Directives, gives the Commission powers to oversee the national regulatory measures by way of the consultation and transparency procedures provided for under Article 7 of the </p>
<p>. The Commission has received more than 100 market notifications, and has made detailed comments on a number of these, although only three have so far led to a veto decision. The Parliament has been, and will be, informed of the outcome of the process leading to such decisions.</p>
<p>The new framework has therefore already allowed NRAs to take action to ensure better regulation in the sector in line with the objectives of the framework. The Commission is pressing all Member States to complete their notifications as rapidly as possible to enable this process of tailored and proportionate regulation to be carried forward.</p>
<p>As regards the provision of cheaper services to consumers and the impact the opening of markets had on the consumer’s wallet, it is clear that the full liberalisation of telecommunications markets on 1 January 1998 brought tangible results for consumers.</p>
<p>Between August 1998 and August 2003, for example, calls from fixed telephones allowed residential and business users in Europe to save 13% and 23% respectively on their average monthly telephone bills. The savings were even more dramatic for international calls, where the average cost of 10 minute calls to all Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries fell by 41% for residential users and by 45% for business users during the same period.</p>
<p>Liberalisation has also brought consumers greater choice. For example, last year a third of EU subscribers were using an alternative provider (i.e. not the incumbent operator) for long-distance and international calls. There is also a growing choice of broadband internet services at different levels of quality and price to suit the needs, and the wallets, of different consumers.</p>
<p>However, there are concerns relating to the high cost of calls to mobile networks. This problem is being tackled by the inclusion by the Commission of this market in its Recommendation on relevant markets. In principle, all operators have significant market power in their own networks, and NRAs can consequently apply appropriate regulation to remedy competitive distortions. The Commission believes this will bring termination rates down considerably.</p>
<p>There are also concerns as to the level of international roaming charges. The Commission is currently carrying out an investigation using its competition law powers. In addition, other measures under the new regulatory framework can be brought to bear on this issue. The Commission’s Recommendation on relevant markets identifies the wholesale national market for international roaming as a market that may be subject to ex-ante regulation if it is found not to be competitive. Although these are national markets, NRAs are working on a coordinated response, given the international nature of the issue. These actions are complementary and, combined with technologies providing the possibility for calls to be routed over the network offering the lowest-priced roaming when visiting another EU country, will enable the Commission to bring maximum pressure to bear in favour of consumers.</p>
<p>As regards the Lisbon objectives, the Heads of State and of Government rightly pinpointed the full and effective implementation of the regulatory framework as one of the essential elements. However, regulatory reform does not yield results overnight. The reform aims first of all to increase legal certainty by providing market players with a stable but flexible framework as a platform for investment and the introduction of innovative services. In the five years to 2003, new entrant fixed line operators alone invested 70 billion € in the EU 15, and are looking to invest 18.5 billion € in the three years to 2006<a href="#defann_54_1" name="refann_54_1"><sup>(1)</sup></a>. These investments will happen if the new legal framework is correctly implemented.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) Disciplinary procedure is necessarily confidential and the Commission is consequently not at liberty to go beyond the information given, in summary, in its press release.</p>
<p>The Commission can, within that necessary limitation, inform the Honourable Member:</p>
<p>That the issue of public statements made by Commission representatives to which he referred in his question was specifically raised before the Disciplinary Board and the Board gave full and careful consideration to that matter in its Opinion;</p>
<p>That the Staff Regulations require the members of the Disciplinary Board to be completely independent in the performance of their duties. This Board is composed of two senior officials chosen by lot from a list established by the administration and two senior officials chosen by lot from a list established by the staff trade unions. To further strengthen the independence of the Board its Chairman is a person of good standing from outside the Institution. The current Chairman is a former President of the Court of First Instance.</p>
<p>The Commission therefore refutes the suggestion that Ms Andreasen was judged by senior officials “whose work was the subject of Ms Andreasen’s allegations”, and rejects any implication that the Board lacks impartiality. In fact, not one of the officials on the Disciplinary Board was from Ms Andreasen’s service of origin (DG BUDGET) and none have had any direct involvement in the modernisation of the Commission’s accounting system.</p>
<p>The Commission would further suggest that the Honourable Member gives attention to the fact that Ms Andreasen did not make use of the possibility clearly offered to her by the provisions of the Staff Regulations to reject any of the members of the Disciplinary Board.</p>
<p>- That the Commission considers that Ms Andreasen has had full entitlement to due process and to respect for the presumption of innocence throughout the whole disciplinary procedure. Consistent with that, she continued to receive her full salary throughout the period since procedures were inaugurated in July 2002. Mrs Andreasen was able to fully exercise her rights of defence, including the right to be heard, to submit written comments, to call witnesses, and to be assisted by legal counsel and other persons of her choice at every stage of the procedure.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><br /><a name="H-2004-0362"></a>

<p>(EN) The Commission would like to underline that the European Community has a coherent policy in support of EU shipyards, which face unfair competition from Korean shipyards. This policy consists of five main elements:</p>
<p>World Trade Organisation (WTO) procedure. The Commission has launched a complaint in the WTO against Korea challenging actionable subsidies (restructuring aids) and prohibited subsidies (export contingent aid). The EC considers these measures have caused injury to the European shipyards. The procedure is currently ongoing in Geneva and the outcome is expected early in 2005.</p>
<p>Temporary defensive mechanism. The Commission already in 2001 proposed a temporary defensive aid to help EU shipyards face the unfair Korean competition in several market segments, such as product-, chemical- and Liquified Natural Gaz-tankers and container ships. This aid, of up to 6% of the contract value per ship, is available since October 2002 and was recently prolonged until 31 March 2005.</p>
<p>Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Negotiations to achieve a New shipbuilding. Agreement The aim of the negotiations is to create a real level playing field in the world shipbuilding market and fair competition through two instruments: a strong subsidy discipline and an efficient pricing discipline to address the main distortive effects on the world shipbuilding market. All major shipbuilding nations participate in the negotiations including Korea, China, Japan and the EU. The deadline to conclude such an Agreement is scheduled for the end of 2005.</p>
<p>InterSHIP is a EUR 38 million research project, financed jointly by Euroyards and the Commission and designed to improve the competitiveness of European cruise, ferry and ro-pax shipbuilders, to develop safer and more environmentally friendly ships considering their entire life cycle, and to achieve a drastic reduction of building and development costs as well as time-to-market of innovative solutions.</p>
<p>“LeaderSHIP 2015” is a Commission initiative aiming at strengthening the competitiveness of EC shipyards. The Leadership 2015 Group has identified a number of priorities in the field of maritime industries: strengthening Research &amp; Development and innovation, establishing a level playing field at world level, developing financial and guarantee schemes, ensuring the protection of intellectual property rights, and providing access to a skilled workforce. Implementation of these priorities will be subject to particularly close scrutiny. In both cases, this will mean implementing the guidelines proposed by the Commission and adopted by the Council on the basis of the recommendation of the High-Level groups.</p>
<p>One of the first results of LeaderSHIP is the support for innovation. This was included in the new Framework on State aid to shipbuilding, which is applicable since 1 January 2004 and which allows up to 20% innovation aid for shipbuilding for the innovative parts of the project. Shipbuilding is the only industrial sector in the EU that has access to such aid.</p>
<p>The Commission believes that further consolidation, respecting competition rules, can generate benefits for all types of activity including commercial and naval shipbuilding, and ship repair.</p>
<p>As far as Greek Shipyards are concerned, the Commission has approved in the past large amounts of restructuring aid for all the big shipbuilding companies (Skaramangas, Elefsina and Newrion) in order to facilitate their restructuring.</p>
<p>The Commission is confident that the above measures will contribute to the maintenance of a competitive European shipbuilding sector in the world market.</p>
<p>As far as the respect of labour law is concerned, the Commission wishes to underline that this is a matter which falls under the competence of Member States, including, eventually, national Courts.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

The Law still lays down rules governing servicemen on active duty in the EU Member States Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia, as if they might be invaded by the Russian Army again.

<p>(FR) The sum of EUR 172 000 mentioned by the Commission in its response to Question No <a href="/doceo/document/H-6-2004-0260_EN.html">H-260/04</a> asked by the Honourable Member, concerns all three Commissioners and covers the costs of installation and resettlement (EUR 162 000) and travel expenses (EUR 10 000).</p>
<p>A transitional allowance of some EUR 72 424.65 per month is also awarded to each Commissioner for the three years after they leave. Furthermore, each Commissioner also receives a monthly pension of EUR 387 from the age of 65.</p>
<p>The Commission wishes to draw the Honourable Member’s attention to the fact that the composition of cabinet members taking up their duties on 1 November 2004 has not yet been definitively established. Accordingly, given that the Commission does not know which of the current staff will be leaving, it is not yet in a position to state the exact sum of the costs incurred through the possible departure of the relevant staff of the Commissioners.</p>
<p>Supposing, for example, that each of the 13 external Members (temporary cabinet agents) currently allocated to the three cabinets in question and divided among the three categories A, B and C had to leave the Commission on 31 October, they would receive neither installation/resettlement costs, nor their transitional allowance. They would, however, be refunded their pension rights contributions (28.5% of their gross salary) up to a total and maximum sum of EUR 86 000 for all 13 people concerned.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr>

<p>(EN) The Commission is very concerned about the current unstable situation in Haiti. The fact that the United Nations peace keeping force has not been provided with the total authorized strength makes it very difficult for it to fulfil its mandate and gives the opportunity to the rebels to undermine the Interim Government’s steps to promote stability and strengthen democratic institutions. The Commission hopes that the contributing States will deliver the necessary means to the Mission to establish a secure and stable environment which is crucial for donors efforts in developmental assistance to be successful and sustainable.</p>
<p>However, the recent resumption of violence is not jeopardizing the start of the implementation of Commission supported development aid projects. To respond to the urgent needs, projects are being prepared. A rehabilitation project for € 27.5 million to improve access of the population to basic socio-economic infrastructures and services was launched immediately after the multi donors pledging conference in July 2004.The Commission is keenly aware of the difficult social and economic situation in Haiti. Therefore, the political message reiterating the importance of respect for human rights and the rule of law and the holding of elections in 2005 is delivered in parallel to a substantial funding pledge of over € 270 million.</p>
<p>To reduce the impact of natural disasters in Haiti, there is a need to tackle this problem in a structural way. One of the causes of the latest disaster in Haiti is deforestation. The Commission is funding a territorial geographical information programme for sustainable development in Haiti for € 7 million.</p>
<p>Even during the period that cooperation with the Government of Haiti was restricted, assistance always continued though alternative means in order not to add to the suffering of the Haiti population. Since 1991, close to half a billion Euros of grants have been committed in Haiti by the Commission.</p></td><td align="right" valign="top"> </td></tr></table><table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5"><tr class="footerdocwin"><td></td><td align="right"><a target="_blank" href="/legal-notice/en">Legal notice</a> - <a target="_blank" href="/privacy-policy/en">Privacy policy</a></td></tr></table></td></tr></table></body></html>
